vii</span>PREFATORY NOTE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> strong sympathy with the gipsies
and their children would not allow of my following the example of
daisy-bank sentimental backwood gipsy writers, whose special
qualification is to flatter the gipsies with showers of
misleading twaddle to keep them in ignorance; but I have
preferred for my country&rsquo;s welfare the path that has been
rough, steep, trying, and somewhat dangerous, and open to the
misconception of those little souls who look only at gipsy life
through tinted or prismatic spectacles.</p>
<p>I have throughout tried to give both the lights and shades of
a gipsy wanderer&rsquo;s life, and must leave the result for God
to work out as He may think well.</p>
<p>There may be within these pages smiles for the simple, sighs
for the sad, tears for the sorrowful, joys for the joyous, ideas
for the author, simple hints for the thoughtful, problems for the
inquisitive, prayers for the prayerful, meditations for the
Christian, plans of action for the philanthropist, and
suggestions for the statesman and lawgiver.</p>
<p><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>The
Brickyard, Canal, and Gipsy Children&mdash;as well as my humble
self&mdash;will, as they grow up into a better state of things,
ever have cause to feel thankful for the kindly help rendered to
the cause by the publications of the various sections of the
Christian Church, including the Church of England, the
Presbyterians, the Wesleyans, Congregationalists, Baptists,
Primitive Methodists, Unitarians, Methodist Free Churches,
Methodist New Connexion, Roman Catholics, The Friends, Bible
Christians, The Religious Tract Society, Christian Knowledge
Society, Sunday School Union, Messrs. Cassell, and other
Publishers, the Weekly and Daily Press throughout the country,
almost without exception, together with the various editors and
other writers whose name is Legion.</p>
<h2>NOTE TO SECOND EDITION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the additional illustrations in
this edition I owe my best thanks to Mr. W. Weblyn, the
proprietor and art editor of the <i>Illustrated Sporting and
Dramatic News</i>; Mr. A. Watson, the literary editor; and also
to the Rev. Edward Weldon, M.A., who accompanied me on one of my
visits to the gipsies to take the sketches, which appeared with
an encouraging and helpful notice on March 1, 1884.</p>
<p>I am also much indebted to the Editor of the <i>Pall Mall
Gazette</i> for his sketch and valuable help, and also to others
with kind heart and ready pen, whose names would fill a volume,
for assisting me to place upon the statute book the Canal Boats
Act of 1884, which will, when the whole of my plans are carried
out, bring education and protection to 60,000 canal and gipsy
children, with but little cost or inconvenience to the van and
cabin dwellers.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>A Sunday
Ramble among the Gipsies upon Pump Hill and Loughton.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, April 23, 1882, opened with
a wet morning.&nbsp; The clouds were thick and heavy.&nbsp; The
smoke seemed to hover, struggle and rise again as if life
depended on its mounting higher than the patched and broken roofs
of London houses.&nbsp; The rain came down drearily, dribbly, and
drizzly.&nbsp; It hung upon my garments with saturating
tendencies, and I really got wet through before I was aware of
it.&nbsp; The roads were very uncomfortable for feet in
non-watertight boots.&nbsp; Umbrellas were up.&nbsp; Single
&ldquo;chaps,&rdquo; and others in &ldquo;couples&rdquo; were
wending their way across Victoria Park.&nbsp; The school bells
were chiming out in all directions &ldquo;Come to school,&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is time,&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not delay,&rdquo; &ldquo;Come
to school.&rdquo;&nbsp; In response to the bell-calls the little
prattlers and toddlers were hurrying along to school.&nbsp; Their
big sisters, with &ldquo;jerks and snatches,&rdquo; frequently
called out, &ldquo;Now, then, come along; we shall be too late;
singing will be over, and if it is I&rsquo;ll tell your
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Victoria Park Station the platelayers were at work, and
when I inquired the cause, I was told that the Queen&rsquo;s <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>carriages were
to pass over the line to Loughton at eleven o&rsquo;clock
&ldquo;to try the metals,&rdquo; and to see that the platform was
back enough to allow sufficient space for the footboards of the
royal carriages.&nbsp; In some cases there was not sufficient
space, and the line had to be swung a little to enable the
carriages to pass.</p>
<p>At Stratford I had a few minutes to wait, and a little
conversation with the stationmaster soon satisfied me that he was
an observing and common-sense Christian, with a kind heart and
good wishes for the poor gipsy children.</p>
<p>I arrived at Loughton in time to join in the morning service
conducted by the Wesleyans in a neat iron chapel.&nbsp; The
service was good, plain, and homely, and as such I enjoyed
it.&nbsp; Of course, being a stranger in &ldquo;these
parts,&rdquo; I was eyed o&rsquo;er with &ldquo;wondering
curiosity.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the chapel there was a tall old man
who sat and stood pensively, with his head bending low, during
the services, and whom, without much hesitation, I set down as a
gipsy.&nbsp; He did not seem to enjoy the service.&nbsp; On
inquiry afterwards, I found that my surmise was correct, and that
the tall man was a gipsy Smith, of some seventy winters, who was
born under a tent upon Epping Forest, amongst the brambles,
furze, and heather, with the clouds for a shelter from the
sun&rsquo;s fierce rays in summer, and the slender tent covering,
with the dying embers of a stick fire, to keep body and soul
together in the midst of the wintry blasts, drifting hail, snow,
and sleet, and keen biting frosts to &ldquo;nip the
toes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After climbing the steep and rugged hill, I made my way to
find out a cocoa-nut gambler, who once gave me an invitation to
call upon him when I happened to pass that way.&nbsp; With much
ado and many inquiries I found the man and his wife just
preparing to go with a donkey and a heavy load of nuts to some
secluded spot a few miles away, to &ldquo;pick up a little
money&rdquo; for their &ldquo;wittles.&rdquo;&nbsp; My visit
having ended in moonshine, I now began in earnest to <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>hunt up the
gipsies.&nbsp; A few minutes&rsquo; wandering among the bushes
and by-lanes brought me upon a group of half-starved, dirty,
half-naked, lost little gipsy children, who were carrying sticks
to their wretched dwellings, which were nothing better than
horribly stinking, sickening, muddy wigwams.</p>
<p>On making my way through mud and sink-gutter filth, almost
over &ldquo;boot-tops,&rdquo; I came upon a <i>duelling</i>
which, were I to live to the age of Methuselah, I could never
forget.</p>
<p>Sitting upon an old three-legged chair, and with a bottom
composed of old rags, cord, and broken rushes, was a bulky,
dirty, greasy, idle-looking fellow, who might never have been
washed in his life.&nbsp; I put a few questions to him about the
weather and other trifling matters; but the answers I got from
him were such that I could not understand.&nbsp; To
&ldquo;roker&rdquo; Romany was a thing he could not do.&nbsp;
Mumble and grumble were his scholastic attainments.</p>
<p>At the door stood a poor, old, worn-out pony, which they said
was as &ldquo;dodgy and crafty as any human being.&nbsp; It was a
capital animal in a cart, but would not run at fairs with
children on its back.&nbsp; Immediately you put a child upon its
back it stood like a rock, and the devil could not move
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the room were five children as ragged as wild goats, as
filthy as pigs, and quite as ignorant.&nbsp; On an old
&ldquo;squab bed&rdquo;&mdash;the only bed in the room&mdash;sat
a big, fat, aged gipsy woman, on a par with the man and
children.&nbsp; A young gipsy of about eighteen years stood at
the bottom of the squab bed enjoying his Sunday dinner.&nbsp; In
one hand he held the dirty plate, and the other had to do duty in
place of a knife and fork.&nbsp; Of what the dinner was composed
I could not imagine.&nbsp; It seemed to be a kind of mixture
between meat, soup, fish, broth, roast and <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>fry, thickened
with bones and flavoured with snails and bread.&nbsp; Upon a very
rickety stool sat a girl with a dirty bare bosom suckling a poor
emaciated baby, whose father nobody seemed to know&mdash;and, if
report be true, the less that is said about paternity the
better.&nbsp; In this one little hole, with a boarded floor,
covered with dirt and mud at least half an inch thick, one bed
teeming with vermin, which I saw with my own eyes, and walls
covered with greasy grime, there were a man, woman, girl, young
man, and five children, huddling together on a Christian Sabbath,
in Christian England, within a stone&rsquo;s throw of a Christian
Church and the Church of England day and Sunday school.&nbsp;
None of them had ever been in a day or Sunday school or place of
worship in their lives.&nbsp; They were as truly heathens as the
most heathenish in the world, and as black as the blackest beings
I have ever seen.&nbsp; The only godly ray manifest in this dark
abode was that of gratitude and thankfulness.&nbsp; A pleasing
trait is this.&nbsp; It was a vein embedded in their nature that
only required the touch of sympathy, brotherhood, and kindness to
light up the lives of these poor lost creatures living in
darkness.&nbsp; Natural beauty I saw none inside; but the marks
of sin were everywhere manifest.&nbsp; Just outside this
miserable hive, notwithstanding the stench, the bees were buzzing
about seeking in vain for honey, the butterflies were winging
fruitlessly about trying to find flowers to settle upon; and
across the beautiful forest valley the cuckoo was among the trees
piping forth its ever beautiful, lovely, enchanting, and
never-tiring &ldquo;cuck-coo,&rdquo; &ldquo;cuck-coo,&rdquo;
&ldquo;cuck-coo;&rdquo; throstles, linnets, blackbirds, and
woodpeckers were hopping about from tree to tree within a
stone&rsquo;s throw, sending forth heavenly strains, echoing and
re-echoing in the distance among the wood foliage on this bright
spring Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; I could almost hear with Dr. <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>James Hamilton,
in his &ldquo;Pearl of Parables&rdquo; (<i>Sunday at Home</i>,
1878), a poor gipsy girl singing with tears in her
eyes&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Some angel in the land of love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For love should pity me,<br />
And draw me in like Noah&rsquo;s dove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From wastes of misery.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lark echoes in the air&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But I would seek on earth below<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A space for heaven to win,<br />
To cheer one heart bowed down by woe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To save one soul from sin.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I left this hut, after taking a breath of fresh air, for
another gipsy <i>dwelling</i> round the corner, picking my way
among the masses of filth as well as I could.&nbsp; Here another
sight, not quite so sickening, but equally heartrending,
presented itself.&nbsp; A gipsy woman was squatting upon the
filthy boards, the father was sitting upon a rickety old chair
without any bottom in it; <i>i.e.</i>, there were a few cords
tied across which served to hold up one or two dirty rags, and
these were sunk so low that any one sitting upon the chair could
feel nothing but the rims, which were not at all
comfortable.&nbsp; Round the man and woman were six children of
all ages and sizes, partially dressed in filthy rags and old
shoes, which seemed to have been picked out of the ashes upon
Hackney Marshes, all of which were much too large for their
little feet, and were stuffed with rags.&nbsp; One little girl
had a pair of cast-off woman&rsquo;s shoes, possessing little
sole and almost less &ldquo;uppers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gipsy father was partially blind through having been in so
many gipsy combats.&nbsp; A kick over the eyes had not only
nearly blinded him, but as B. said, &ldquo;I feel at times as if
my senses were nearly gone.&nbsp; Thank the Lord, I can see best
when the sun shines clear.&rdquo;&nbsp; On my <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>approaching
nearer to where they were sitting the man got up and kindly
offered me his <i>chair</i>, which I accepted, notwithstanding
the disagreeable surroundings.&nbsp; On the walls of their
<i>dwelling</i> pieces of pictures and old newspapers were
pasted.&nbsp; There were parts of <i>The British Workman</i>,
<i>Band of Hope Review</i>, <i>Old Jonathan</i>, <i>The Cottager
and Artizan</i>, <i>Churchman&rsquo;s Almanack</i>; in fact, they
seemed to have upon the greasy walls a scrap of some of the
pictorial publications published by the Wesleyans, Baptists,
Church of England, the Unitarians, Congregationalists, the
Religious Tract Society, Cassell, Sunday School Union, Haughton
and Co., Partridge and Co., Dr. Barnardo, and others.&nbsp; I
said to the poor man, &ldquo;This is a very tumbledown old
place.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;people say
that it has been built nine hundred years; and I believe it has,
for the man who owns it now says he cannot remember it being
built.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;How old do you think the man
is who owns it?&rdquo;&nbsp; He answered, &ldquo;Well, I should
think that he is fifty, for he has great
grand-children.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their only table consisted of an old
box, upon which, in a wicker basket, there were a young jay and a
blackbird which the gipsy woman was trying to rear.&nbsp; As the
young birds opened their beaks, almost wide enough to swallow
each other, the woman kept thrusting into their mouths large
pieces of stinking meat of some kind, about which I did not ask
any particulars.&nbsp; These little gipsy attractions and
observations being over, I began to inquire about things
concerning their present and eternal welfare.&nbsp; I found on
inquiry that the only food this family had had to live upon
during the last two days had been a threepenny loaf and half an
ounce of tea.&nbsp; When I asked them what they did for a living
they could scarcely tell me.&nbsp; The man said, &ldquo;I go out
sometimes with a basket and a few oranges in it, and I picks up a
bit of a living in this way.&nbsp; Some of the people are pretty
good to me.&nbsp; As a rule we begs our <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>clothes.&nbsp; Occasionally I catches
a rabbit or picks up a hedgehog.&nbsp; If I can scrape together a
shilling to buy oranges I generally manages pretty well for that
day.&nbsp; Our firing does not cost us anything, and in
summer-time the young uns picks up a lot of birds&rsquo; eggs out
of the forest, which are very nice for them if they are not too
far hatched.&rdquo;&nbsp; Just at this juncture a practical
demonstration took place as to how they dealt with the
birds&rsquo; eggs.&nbsp; One of the boys, I should think of about
seven years, came with a nest of blackbirds&rsquo;
eggs&mdash;poor little fellow he was no doubt hungry, for he had
had no Sunday dinner&mdash;which he placed into his
mother&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; The mother was not long before she
began to crack them, and into the children&rsquo;s mouths they
went, half hatched as they were, just as she fed the young
jay.&nbsp; I really thought that one of the youngsters would have
been choked by one of the half-hatched young blackbirds.&nbsp;
With a little crushing, cramming, and tapping on the back the
poor Sunday dinnerless gipsy child escaped the sad consequences I
at one time feared would be the result.&nbsp; To see a woman
forcing food of this description down a child&rsquo;s throat is a
sight I never want to see again.&nbsp; Hunger opens a mouth that
turns sickening food into dainty morsels.&nbsp; None of these
poor gipsy children had ever lisped a godly prayer or read a word
in their lives.&nbsp; The father said he would be glad to send
the children to school if they would be received there and they
could go free.&nbsp; The whole of these children were born in a
tent upon a bit of straw among the low bushes of Epping
Forest.&nbsp; Some in the depth of severe winter, others in the
midst of drenching rains, and even when the larks were singing
overhead, with &ldquo;roughish nurses and midwives&rdquo; as
attendants.</p>

</a></p>
<p>I found that this &ldquo;gipsy-man&rdquo; had been a
Sunday-school scholar, but somehow or other&mdash;he did not seem
desirous of saying how&mdash;he got among a gang of gipsies in <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>early
life.&nbsp; He left his praying mother for the life of a vagabond
among tramps, with a relish for hedgehogs, snails, and diseased
pork.&nbsp; He said he liked hedgehog-pie better than any other
food in the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two hedgehogs will make a good
pie,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; He also said that he was once with a
tribe of gipsy tramps, and he laid a wager that he &ldquo;could
make them all sick of hedgehogs.&rdquo;&nbsp; They told him he
could not.&nbsp; The result was he set off to a place he well
knew in the neighbourhood and caught twenty-one hedgehogs.&nbsp;
These were all cooked, some in clay and others turned into soup,
and all the gipsies who ate them &ldquo;were made sick, excepting
an old woman of the name of Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He next told me how to cook snails, which he liked very much,
and wished he had a dish before him then.&nbsp; The snails, he
said, &ldquo;were boiled, and then put in salt and water, after
which they were boiled again, and then were ready for
eating.&rdquo;&nbsp; Feeling desirous of changing the subject, I
reverted to his Sunday-school experience, and asked if he could
remember anything he once read (he could not now read a sentence)
or sung.&nbsp; All he could remember, he said, was &ldquo;In my
father&rsquo;s house are many mansions,&rdquo; and a bit of a
song&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here we suffer grief and pain,<br />
Here we meet to part again;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In heaven we part no more.<br />
Oh! that will be joyful.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My heart bled, and I felt that I could have wept tears of
sorrow as I sat in the midst of this family of our present-day
gipsies.&nbsp; In these two tumble-down wooden dwellings there
were two men and three women and twelve children growing up in
the densest ignorance, barbarism, and sin.</p>
<p>I gave the mother and children some money wherewith to buy
some food, and I left them with gratitude beaming <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>out of their
dirty faces.&nbsp; In going down the hill, a couple of hundred
yards from this hotbed of sin, iniquity, and wretchedness, I came
upon a party of about one hundred and fifty beautifully dressed
and happy Sunday-school children tripping along joyfully with
their teachers by their side to an afternoon service in the
church close by.&nbsp; I could almost imagine them to be singing
as I looked into their cheery faces, and nothing would have given
me greater pleasure than to have sung out with them
lustily&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Merrily,
merrily, onward we go.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The five minutes&rsquo; trotting down the hill with this
youthful encouraging band brought my forty years&rsquo; joyous
and soul-saving episodes of Sunday-school life vividly before me,
which had the soothing effect of temporarily shaking off my late
hour&rsquo;s experiences with the gipsies, and causing my heart
to dance for joy.</p>
<p>A little later on I took the main road to High Beach and the
&ldquo;Robin Hood.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had not got far upon the way
before I was accosted by three semi-drunken,
&ldquo;respectable&rdquo;-looking roughs, asking all sorts of
insulting questions; and because I could not point them to a
&ldquo;California,&rdquo; but rather to a &ldquo;Bedlam,&rdquo; I
really thought that I should have to &ldquo;lookout for
squalls.&rdquo;&nbsp; They began in earnest to close round
me.&nbsp; By a little man&oelig;uvring, and the fortunate
appearance of two or three gentlemen, I eluded their
clutches.</p>
<p>The road up the hill to the &ldquo;Robin Hood&rdquo; was
literally crowded with travellers, foolish and gay; cabs and
carriages teemed with passengers of the gentle and simple sort,
roughs and riffraff, went puffing and panting along.&nbsp; There
were the thick and thin, tall and short, weak and strong, all
jostling together as on Bank Holidays.&nbsp; I could hardly
realize the fact that it was an English Sunday.&nbsp; In one
trap, drawn by a poor bony animal scarcely able to crawl, there
were fifteen men, women, and children, shouting <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>and screaming
as if it were a fair day&mdash;wild, mad, and frantic with swill
to their heart&rsquo;s core.&nbsp; The gipsies were in full
swing.&nbsp; There were no less than fifty horses and donkeys
running, galloping, trotting, and walking, with men, women, and
children upon their backs.&nbsp; Half-tipsy girls seemed to have
lost all sense of modesty and shame.&nbsp; The long sticks of the
gipsies laid heavily upon the bones of the poor animals set the
women and girls &ldquo;a-screeching&rdquo; and shouting, sounds
which did not rise very high before they were turned into
God&rsquo;s curses.</p>
<p>I knew many of the gipsies, and, contrary to what I had
expected, I did not receive one cross look.&nbsp; The eldest son
of a gipsy, named Pether, to whom I shall refer later on, took me
into his tea, gingerbeer, and pop tent; and nothing would satisfy
him but that I must have some gingerbeer and cake, and while I
was eating he handed me his fat baby to look at.&nbsp; It
certainly bade fair to become a bigger man than General Tom
Thumb.&nbsp; I touched the baby&rsquo;s cheek and put a small
coin in its tiny hand.&nbsp; I also spoke a word of genuine
praise to the young gipsy mother on account of the good start she
was making, and afterwards I shook hands with the gipsy pair and
bade them good-bye.&nbsp; To Pether&rsquo;s credit be it said
that, although he owns horses, swings, cocoa-nuts, &amp;c., he
never employs them on Sundays.&nbsp; His gipsy father had told
him more than once that &ldquo;there is no good got by it.&nbsp;
I have noticed it more than once, what&rsquo;s got by cocoa-nuts,
swings, and horses on Sunday, the devil fetches before dinner on
Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon the forest, on God&rsquo;s day of rest, there were no
fewer than from five hundred to one thousand gipsy children, not
a dozen of whom could read and write a sentence, or had ever been
in a place of worship.</p>
<p>In going to my friend&rsquo;s, the house-dwelling gipsy, for
tea, in response to his kind invitation, that we might <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>have a chat
together, I called to see a gipsy woman of the name of B&mdash;
whom I knew, as I also did her parents, who had recently come to
live in the place.&nbsp; When I arrived at the wretched,
miserable, dirty abode, I found that her gipsy husband had been
sent for, and was now &ldquo;doing fourteen
years&rdquo;&mdash;for what offence I did not attempt to find
out&mdash;and that his place had been filled by another idle
scamp; and, if reports be true, he has also been sent for
&ldquo;to do double duty,&rdquo; and whose place also has been
filled up in the social circle with another gipsy.&nbsp; This
gipsy woman has entered into a fourth alliance, and, as one of
the gipsies recently said, she has really been
&ldquo;churched&rdquo; this time.&nbsp; I saw much, smelt a deal,
but said little; and, after giving the poor child of six a
trifle, I made haste to join my friends the gipsies at tea.</p>
<p>When I was invited, my friend Pether said: &ldquo;You could
not mistake the house.&nbsp; Over the door it reads, &lsquo;J.
Pether, the Ratcatcher and Butcher.&rsquo;&nbsp; If you ask any
one in Loughton for &lsquo;Scarecrow,&rsquo;
&lsquo;<i>Poshcard</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;Shovecard,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Jack Scare,&rsquo; they will direct you to my house.&nbsp;
I am known for miles round.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course I had no
difficulty in finding my friend, with so many names and
titles.&nbsp; On arriving at the door my big friend came hobbling
along to open it.&nbsp; If my little hand had been a rough, big,
cocoa-nut that he had been going to &ldquo;shie&rdquo; with
vengeance at somebody&rsquo;s head, he could not have given it a
firmer grip.&nbsp; Fortunately he did not break any bones in
it.&nbsp; I had not been long seated upon the bench before his
&ldquo;poorly&rdquo; wife came downstairs.&nbsp; The best cups
and saucers were set on a coverless table, and the cake, which
was a little too rich, was placed thereon.&nbsp; By the side of
the fireplace upon the floor was their poor crippled son of about
sixteen years, who had lost the use of his arms and legs, but had
retained his senses.&nbsp; Tea was handed out to <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>us, and I did
fairly well.&nbsp; I enjoyed the tea, although I felt pained and
sorrowful to see a sharp youth confined at home under such sad
circumstances.&nbsp; They did their best to make me happy and
comfortable.&nbsp; At our table sat one of Mr. Pether&rsquo;s
sons, who was in the militia.&nbsp; He had a kindly word for
almost everybody in the regiment to which he belonged, especially
for the Duke of Connaught, who had a kindly word for him.&nbsp;
The Duke asked him one day if he would like to join the Line, to
which young Pether said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Duke
is a gentleman, and pleases everybody,&rdquo; said Pether, the
young militiaman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily, this is a truth spoken by
a gipsy soldier,&rdquo; I said to Pether senior.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, governor,&rdquo; said Mr. Pether; &ldquo;and the
Queen is a good woman, too.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which I replied,
&ldquo;There could not be a better; she is the best Queen that
England ever saw.&rdquo;&nbsp; This brought a smile upon their
faces over our hot gipsy tea.</p>
<p>Tea was now over, and our chat began.&nbsp; The first thing I
said to Mr. Pether was, &ldquo;How is it that you have become a
gipsy with so many names?&rdquo;&nbsp; This question called forth
a laugh and a groan.&nbsp; A laugh, because it brought to his
mind so many reminiscences of bygone days; and a groan, because
his gouty leg had an extra twinge from some cause or other, which
caused him to pull a wry face for a minute.&nbsp; I could not
help smiling, when with one breath he laughed out, &ldquo;Ah, ah,
ah, ah!&rdquo; and in the next he cried out, &ldquo;Oh, oh! it
almost makes me sweat.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, to begin at the
beginning, sir, my father was a butcher and farmer, and he sent
me early to London&mdash;I think before I was nine years
old&mdash;to be with an uncle, who was a butcher.&nbsp; I was
with him for a few years, but he was not very kind.&nbsp; He used
to put me to the worst and coldest kind of work, winter or
summer; and I was often put upon by his man and a young chap he
had.&nbsp; The chap used to plague me terribly, and call me all
sorts of names; and I was a lad <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>that was tempery and peppery, and
would not be put on by anybody.&nbsp; One day the chap begun to
leather me with a cow&rsquo;s tongue, which cuts like a knife,
upon the bare skin.&nbsp; He leathered me so much that blood ran
down my arms and face.&nbsp; This got my blood up, and while he
was bending to pick up something I seized the poleaxe that stood
close by and struck him when no one was near with the sharp edge
of it upon his head, the same as I would a bullock, and felled
him to the ground like an ox.&nbsp; As soon as I saw blood
flowing I made sure that I had killed him, and, without waiting
to pick up my clothes, I ran off as fast as my legs would carry
me, without stopping till I got to Harrow-on-the-Hill.&nbsp; I
dirted my clothes and coat and mangled them so that nobody could
tell me, and I changed my name to &lsquo;Poshcard&rsquo; for a
time.&nbsp; I then began to wander about the lanes, and to beg,
and to sleep in the barns and under stacks on the roadside.&nbsp;
Sometimes I could pick up a job at butchers&rsquo;, doing what
they call &lsquo;running guts&rsquo; for sausages and black
pudding.&nbsp; My clothes at times were all alive.&nbsp; When
anybody gave me an old coat or shirt, socks or boots, I never
took them off till they dropped off.&nbsp; I have slept under
ricks in the winter till the straw has been frozen to my
feet.&nbsp; Hundreds of times I have slept between the cows for
warmth, while they have lain down in the sheds and
cow-houses.&nbsp; I used to creep in between them softly and
snoozle the night away.&nbsp; The warmth of the cows has kept me
alive hundreds of times.&nbsp; I have at times almost lived on
carrots.&nbsp; When blackberries were ripe I used to eat many of
them; in fact, I used to steal peas and beans, or any mortal
thing that I came near.&nbsp; Sometimes I fell in with
drovers.&nbsp; I have got in the winter-time under a hedge and
nibbled a turnip for my Sunday dinner.&nbsp; I was for some time
with a farmer, and used to mind his cattle, and he got to like me
so much that he used to place confidence in me.&nbsp; He <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>would trust
me with anything.&nbsp; One time he sent me to sell a calf for
him, but instead of returning with the money I ran away and
bought a suit of clothes with it.&nbsp; I durst not face him
again after that.&nbsp; For fourteen years I was wandering up and
down England in this way, daily expecting to be taken up for
murder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I then joined a gang of gipsies of the name of Lee, and
with them I have lied, lived, stole, and slept, more like a dog
than a human being.&nbsp; I used to run donkeys all day, and when
the old woman came home from fortune-telling she would give me
two pieces of bread and butter from somebody&rsquo;s table for my
dinner and tea which some of the servant girls had given to
her.&nbsp; Among the gipsies I used to be reckoned the very
devil.&nbsp; I have fought hundreds of times, and was never
beaten in my life.&nbsp; The time when I was more nearly beaten
than any other was with my brother-in-law, a gipsy.&nbsp; We
fought hard and fast, up and down, for nearly an hour, and then
we gave it up as both of us being as good as each other.&nbsp; I
have had both my arms broken, legs broken, shoulder-blades
broken, and kicked over my head till I have been senseless, in
gipsy rows.&nbsp; Oh! sir, I could tell you a lot more, and I
will do so sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This terrible recital of facts&mdash;of the cruelty,
hardships, wrong-doing of present-day gipsy life&mdash;almost
caused my hair to stand on an end whilst he related the horrors
of backwood and daylight gipsyism in our midst.</p>
<p>I asked Mr. Pether if the gipsies were on the increase in the
country so far as he knew.&nbsp; He answered&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think they are very much.&nbsp; Gipsies seem
to be in the lanes everywhere.&nbsp; I have seen as many as five
hundred tents and vans in the forest before now at one
time.&nbsp; There are not so many now, as you know; but they have
spread all over the country, because the rangers would not allow
the gipsies to stay upon the forest all <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>night.&nbsp;
Some of the gipsies have made heaps of money by
fortune-telling.&nbsp; Lord bless you! I knew the family of gipsy
Smiths, they seemed to have so much money that they did not know
what to do with it.&nbsp; They seemed to have gold and diamond
rings upon all their fingers.&nbsp; They took their money to
America, and I have not heard what has become of them
since.&nbsp; Some of the family are left about the forest now as
poor as rats.&nbsp; The gipsies are a rum lot, I can assure
you.&nbsp; I do not know a dozen gipsies to-day who can read and
write, and none of them ever go, or think of going, to church or
chapel.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you ever been in a place of
worship since you ran away from home?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Scare,&rdquo; &ldquo;except when I
went with my old woman to be wed; and thank God I can show the
&lsquo;marriage lines.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not many of the gipsies can
show their &lsquo;marriage lines,&rsquo; I can assure you.&nbsp;
I have not been in either church or chapel, except then, for
nearly fifty years.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Did you ever
pray?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Scare,&rdquo;
&ldquo;but I swears thousands of times.&nbsp; Mother prays for me
and that has to do.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a good old
creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Now Mr. Pether, from what cause did you receive
the name of &lsquo;Scare&rsquo;?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, to
tell you the truth,&rdquo; said Mr. &ldquo;Scare,&rdquo;
&ldquo;at the edge of the forest there was a little low
public-house, kept by a man and his wife, which we gipsies used
to visit.&nbsp; In course of time the man died, and the old woman
used to always be crying her eyes up about the loss of her poor
&lsquo;Bill;&rsquo; at least, she seemed to be always crying
about him, which I knew was not real&mdash;she did not care a rap
about the old man&mdash;so I thought I would have a lark with the
old girl.&nbsp; In the yard there were a lot of fowls, and just
before the old girl went to bed&mdash;and I knew which bed she
slept in&mdash;I put up the window and turned one of the fowls
into the room and then pulled it gently down again, and I then
stood back in the yard.&nbsp; Presently the old girl, I could see
by the <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>light, was making for her bedroom, which was on the
ground floor.&nbsp; No sooner had the old girl opened the door
than the fowl began &lsquo;scare!&rsquo; &lsquo;scare!&rsquo;
&lsquo;scare!&rsquo; &lsquo;scare!&rsquo; and
&lsquo;flusker&rsquo; and &lsquo;flapper&rsquo; about the
room.&nbsp; The old lady was so frightened that she dropped the
candle upon the floor and ran out in the yard calling out
&lsquo;Murder!&rsquo; &lsquo;murder!&rsquo;
&lsquo;murder!&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course I dared not be seen and
sneaked away.&nbsp; Early next morning I went to the house and
called for some beer.&nbsp; No sooner had I entered than the old
girl told me that she had seen her husband&rsquo;s ghost on the
bed, and it had almost frightened her wild.&nbsp; It had made
every hair upon her head stand upright.&nbsp; It was her
husband&rsquo;s ghost, she was sure it was, she said; and nobody
could make her believe it was not; and from that night the old
woman would not sleep in the room again.&nbsp; She very soon left
the public-house, and one of my friends took it.&nbsp; From this
circumstance I have gone in the name of &lsquo;Jack
Scare.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, what have you to say
about the name &lsquo;Scarecrow,&rsquo; by which you are
known?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Scarecrow,&rdquo; said Mr. Pether,
&ldquo;was given to me after I had fetched, in the dead of the
night, a bough of the tree upon which a man had hung himself a
few days before.&nbsp; It arose in this way.&nbsp; A man hung
himself in a wood through some girl, and after he was cut down
and buried a gipsy I knew begged or bought his clothes for a
little&mdash;I could not say what the amount was, I think five
shillings&mdash;and wore them.&nbsp; Chaff, jokes, and sneers
with that gipsy for wearing the dead man&rsquo;s clothes resulted
in a bet being made for five shillings as to whether I dare, or
dare not, visit the spot where the man was hung at midnight hour,
and bring some token or proof from the place as having been
there.&nbsp; I went and fetched a bough of the very same tree,
and from that circumstance I have been called
&lsquo;scarecrow&rsquo; or &lsquo;dare-devil.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>Poshcard</i>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<i>Shovecard</i>&rsquo;
was given to me because I was always a good <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>hand at
cheating with cards.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Posh</i> among the gipsies
and in Romany means &ldquo;half,&rdquo; and I suppose they really
looked upon Pether as having half gipsy blood in his veins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how are you getting on now?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, I am getting on pretty well, thank God.&nbsp; I
never work my horse on Sundays, and I do not cheat the same as I
used to do.&nbsp; Some days I earn &pound;6 or &pound;7, and then
again I shall be for days and days and not earn sixpence.&nbsp; I
also go a rat-catching and butchering for people, and they pays
me pretty well; and sometimes I fetches a hare or two.&nbsp; I am
not particular if partridges or pheasants come in my way.&nbsp;
If you will let me know the next time you are this way I will
have a first-rate hare for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course I thanked
him, but told my friend that I was not partial to hares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, Mr. Pether, let us come back again to the
time when you ran away, after felling the chap with the
poleaxe.&nbsp; Did you kill the man?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Pether, &ldquo;I have found out since that
I did not kill him, but I gave him a terrible scalp.&nbsp; He is
dead now, poor chap.&nbsp; I have wished many thousands of times
since that I had not struck him, though he did wrong in
leathering me with a cow&rsquo;s tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did your friends find you out at last?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Pether, &ldquo;after I ran away from
home my mother advertised for me all over the country, spending
scores of pounds to no purpose.&nbsp; On account of my changing
my clothes and name, and travelling with gipsies and tramps, and
becoming as one of them, they could never find me out, till I had
been away nearly eighteen years.&nbsp; How I was found out arose
as follows.&nbsp; One day I was sitting in a beershop with some
gipsies, when a man came in who knew me, and he seemed to look,
and look and eye me over, head and foot, from top to bottom, as
he never had done before.&nbsp; While he was looking at me, it
seemed to <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>strike me at once that I was at last found out for the
murder I had always thought that I had committed.&nbsp; He went
away for a little time out of the public-house, and as it has
been told me since, he went to the telegraph office to send a
telegram to my brother-in-law, who was in London, not many miles
away, to come down by the next train, for they had found out who
they thought to be their &lsquo;Jack.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was not
away very long, and I was in twenty minds to have run out of the
house; but as he did not come back in a few minutes, I thought I
was wrong in judging that I had been found out.&nbsp; Lord bless
you, sir, did not I open my eyes when he came in again and
brought one or two men with him, and sat down and called for some
beer.&nbsp; My legs and knees began to knock together; I was all
of a tremble, and I got up to go out of the house, but they
called for some beer and would not let me leave the place.&nbsp;
For the life of me I could not make it all out.&nbsp; Sometimes I
imagined the new-comers were detectives in disguise.&nbsp; They
joked and chaffed and seemed quite merry.&nbsp; I can assure you,
sir, that I was not merry.&nbsp; I got up several times to try to
get out of the house, and to sneak away.&nbsp; He ordered some
dinner, and would have no &lsquo;nay,&rsquo; but that I must join
them.&nbsp; I tried to eat with them, but I can assure you, sir,
it was not much that I could either eat or drink.&nbsp;
Presently, after dinner, another man came into the room and sat
down and called for some beer.&nbsp; I did not know the
man.&nbsp; It has turned out since that the last comer was no
other than my brother-in-law.&nbsp; It flashed across me that I
was at last found out, and no mistake.&nbsp; I was a doomed man;
and this surmise seemed to be doubly true when he took out of his
pocket a newspaper and began to read an advertisement giving the
description of me at the time I ran away.&nbsp; They now called
me by my own name, and asked the landlord to allow me to have a
wash, which <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>he readily granted.&nbsp; When this was over and I was
ready, they said, &lsquo;Now, Jack, we shall want you to go with
us.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course there was nothing for it but to
go.&nbsp; The worst was come, and I thought I must screw up
courage and face it out as well as I could.&nbsp; On our way we
called at the telegraph office, where one of the men sent
something by telegraph.&nbsp; I did not know what.&nbsp; I have
since heard that it was a telegram to my mother, stating that
they had found her son &lsquo;Jack,&rsquo; and they were on the
way to her house with him.&nbsp; On the way through London to go,
as I thought, to the police-station, we turned off the main
street to go up a by-street.&nbsp; For the life of me I could not
tell where this was, except that they were going to change my
clothes, or put &lsquo;steel buckles&rsquo; upon my wrists.&nbsp;
We went into a tidy sort of a little house, which I thought was
the home of one of the detectives who was with us.&nbsp; I was
asked to sit upon the old sofa, and the men sat round the
fire.&nbsp; For a little while all was as still as death.&nbsp;
Presently I heard someone coming downstairs.&nbsp; The footstep
did not sound like that of a man.&nbsp; In a minute there stood
before me a woman between fifty and sixty years old.&nbsp; I
thought I had seen the face somewhere, but could not tell
where.&nbsp; The voice seemed to be a voice that I had heard
somewhere, times back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mystery was soon solved, the secret was soon
out.&nbsp; As she looked into my face, she cried out, &lsquo;Art
thou my son John, who ran away from his place nearly twenty years
ago, and for whom I have prayed every day since that the Lord
would bring you back to me before I died?&rsquo;&nbsp; And then
she came a little nearer, and looked into my face a little
closer, and cried out, &lsquo;Thou art my son, John; bless the
dear good Lord for preserving thee all these years.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I said, &lsquo;Are you my mother?&rsquo; tremblingly.&nbsp; And
she took hold of me and put her arms round me, and clasped me
closely to her, and she cried and sobbed <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>out for a
minute or two, and then, with tears streaming down her face upon
my shoulder, said, while trembling and almost fainting, &lsquo;I
am thy mother, my son John; let me kiss thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
she kissed me, and I kissed her.&nbsp; I cried, and she cried; I
thought we were not going to be parted again.&nbsp; We were in
each other&rsquo;s arms for a few moments, and the man who
brought the newspaper to the public-house to recognize me, made
himself known to me as my brother-in-law.&nbsp; Some of my
brothers came in the evening&mdash;and an evening it was.&nbsp; I
shall never forget our meeting while I live.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And you could have sung from your heart, Pether,
&lsquo;Come let us be merry, for this my son was dead and is
alive again, was lost and is found.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes I could.&nbsp; I always felt, and do so still feel,
that when I am gipsying, as you sometimes see me at &lsquo;Robin
Hood,&rsquo; my mother&rsquo;s prayers are heard by God.&nbsp;
She is a good creature, and is alive and lives with my sister at
Battersea.&nbsp; I often go to see her.&nbsp; She is a good
creature.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Pether, while narrating his troubles,
difficulties, hairbreadth escapes, broke out frequently into sobs
and cries almost like a child.</p>
<p>I bade my friends the gipsies good-bye and, after giving the
poor crippled boy something to please him, I started to go to the
station, but found out that I should have an hour to wait.&nbsp;
I therefore turned into a Wesleyan Chapel to enjoy a partial
service, at the close of which the choir and the congregation,
including a gipsy Smith and his wife, sung with tear-fetching
expression and feeling&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jerusalem my happy home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Name ever dear to me;<br />
When shall my labours have an end,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In joy and peace with thee?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this impressive service time, steam and
&ldquo;shanks&rsquo;s pony&rdquo; carried and wafted me back to
my friends in Victoria Park, none the worse for my Sunday ramble
among the gipsies.</p>
<h2><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>Rambles among the Gipsies in Epping Forest.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> being kept in bed at a
friend&rsquo;s house by pain and prostration for forty hours, it
was pleasant to tramp upon the green, mossy sward of Nature in
Victoria Park on a bright Easter Monday morning, with the sun
winking and blinking in my face through the trees on my way to
the station in the midst of a throng of busy holiday-seekers,
dressed in their best clothes, with all the variety of colour and
fashion that can only be seen on a bank-holiday.&nbsp; The
fashions worn by the ladies ranged from the reign of Queen Anne
to that of the latest fantasy under our good Queen Victoria, with
plenty of room for digression and varieties according to the
individual taste and vagary.&nbsp; Some of the ladies&rsquo;
pretty faces were not without colour which makes &ldquo;beautiful
for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were others who might almost claim
relationship to Shetland ponies, for their hair hung over their
foreheads, covering their &ldquo;witching eyes,&rdquo; making
them like two-year old colts, and as if they were ashamed to show
the noble foreheads God had given them.&nbsp; Others were walking
on stilts, evidently with much discomfort, and with both eyes
shut <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>to
the injury they were inflicting upon their delicate frames and
constitutions.&nbsp; This class of young ladies evidently thought
that high heels, pretty ankles, and small feet, with plenty of
giggle and bosh, were the things to &ldquo;trap &rsquo;em and
catch &rsquo;em.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor things! they are terribly
mistaken on this point.&nbsp; The things to &ldquo;trap &rsquo;em
and catch &rsquo;em&rdquo; are graceful action, modest reserve,
soft looks, a heart full of sympathy, tenderness, goodness, and
kindness.&nbsp; Few young men can withstand these
&ldquo;fireworks.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are the things which make
&ldquo;beautiful for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fashions adopted by the gentlemen were all
&ldquo;cuts&rdquo; and &ldquo;shapes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Naughty
children vulgarly call them &ldquo;young
dandies&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;flashy fops&rdquo; whose brains and
money&mdash;if they ever had any&mdash;vanish into smoke or the
fumes of a beer barrel.&nbsp; Their garments were covered with
creases, caused by the ironing process at their
&ldquo;uncle&rsquo;s,&rdquo; which certainly did not add to their
appearance, or the elegance of their figures.&nbsp; As they
yawned, laughed, shouted, and giggled upon the platform, with
their mouths open&mdash;not quite as wide as Jumbo&rsquo;s when
apples are thrown at him&mdash;it was not surprising that flies
fast disappeared.</p>
<p>There were others whose head and face had the appearance of
having been in many a storm of the &ldquo;bull and pup&rdquo;
fashion.&nbsp; They wore pantaloons tight round the knees and
wide about the ankles, and coats made of a small Scotch plaid,
blue and black cloth, with pockets inside and outside, capable of
holding a few rabbits, hares, and partridges without any
inconvenience to the wearer.&nbsp; At the heels of these gentry,
who loitered about with sticks in their hands, skulked lurcher
dogs.</p>
<p>Frequently I came alongside a young gentleman with an
intelligent face, marked by thought, care, and study, who
evidently was taking an &ldquo;outing&rdquo; for the good of <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>his
health.&nbsp; As he passed the vacant-minded part of the throng
and crush, he seemed to give a kind of side glance of pity and
contempt, and then passed along, keeping a sharp look-out after
his pockets.</p>
<p>Among the crowd of pleasure-seekers there was a large
sprinkling of men with premature grey locks and snowy white hair,
betoking a life of hurry and worry, thought, care, and anxiety,
with several children jumping and frisking round them with glee,
delight, joy, and smiles at the prospect of spending a day with
their fathers in the forest free from school and city life.&nbsp;
As the lovely children were bounding along, it only required a
very slight stretch of imagination to read the thoughts of the
good father, and to hear him saying to the children, &ldquo;I
wish I was young again, I should like to have a romp with you
to-day; my heart beats with joy at seeing you dance about.&nbsp;
God bless you, my dear children; God bless you!&nbsp; I am so
glad to see you so happy.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then tears would
trickle down the face of the early careworn father, at the
thought of a coming parting, when he would have to bid them
good-bye, and leave them in the hands of God and an early widowed
mother, to get along as well as they could in the midst of the
cold shoulders of the friends of the bygone prosperous times, who
have received many favours at the hands of the early grey-bearded
father, but shudder at the thought of being asked by the poor
widow for a favour.</p>
<p>The children, with ringlets and flowing hair and bright eyes,
now cling to him and hold him by the tails of his coat and his
hands, and begin to sing as they speed towards the
forest&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Lion of Judah shall break every
chain<br />
And give us the victory again and again;<br />
Be hushed, my sad spirit, the worst that can come<br />
But shortens the journey and hastens me home.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>And
away they went out of sight among the tussocks of grass, little
hills, hedges, low bushes, and heather, to gather daisies and
other wild flowers, perhaps not to be seen again by me till we
meet on the plains of Paradise.</p>
<p>Among the crowd there were a number of men, who could not be
mistaken by any one who knows anything of literary work and
literary men, trying to get a &ldquo;breath of fresh air&rdquo;
and a few wrinkles off their face, and to come in contact with
some one who could touch the spring of pleasure&mdash;which by
this time had been nearly dried up, or frozen up by studying and
anxiety&mdash;and bring a smile to the face.</p>
<p>I ran against one man who was evidently in deep trouble, and I
began to question him as to the cause of his sorrow, and he told
me as follows: &ldquo;For many years I was a clerk in a
solicitor&rsquo;s office in the city, and on my arrival home at
night, I used to write stories and other things for the papers,
without pay, merely for pleasure.&nbsp; In course of time my
eyesight failed me, and I had to give up my situation.&nbsp; I
thought I would try to write a story for publication, so that I
might maintain my family, and keep them from the workhouse.&nbsp;
I began the tale and finished it.&nbsp; I made sure that I should
have no difficulty in getting some publisher to take it up and
print it for me, and that I should make a fortune, and be made a
man; but to my surprise no one would look at it.&nbsp; I went
from one place to another, day after day, without any success,
returning home every night thoroughly broken down and dispirited,
and to-day I have my manuscript without any prospect of meeting
with a customer, and am strolling here to contemplate the next
step.&rdquo;&nbsp; I gave him a little encouragement, and told
him to cheer up&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Behind a frowning Providence He hides a
smiling face.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We shook hands and parted.</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>I had
not gone far before I overtook a woman in deep mourning, with
four children walking slowly along.&nbsp; There was no
friskiness, liveliness, and sport about this family.&nbsp; The
two least hung as it were upon the skirts of the poor sorrowful
mother&rsquo;s garments.&nbsp; Despair seemed to be written not
only upon their faces, but upon their clothes and actions.&nbsp;
The fountain of tears had been dried up, but not by the kindness
of friends, but by poverty and starvation, with all their grim
horrors staring them in the face, and with the terrible workhouse
as the lot in store for them, till there was scarcely any
vitality left in their system from which tears could be extracted
either by kindness or sorrow.&nbsp; They seemed to be the
embodiment of pallor, languidness, and lifelessness.&nbsp; This
poor woman had had a good education; in fact, her manner and
conversation seemed to be that of a lady who had moved in good
society; but alas, overwork, worry, and death had early robbed
her of a good husband, when he was on the threshold of a
first-class position and a fortune, and all was gone! gone! and
now &ldquo;blank,&rdquo; &ldquo;blank,&rdquo; &ldquo;blank&rdquo;
seemed to be written everywhere.&nbsp; I tried to console her
best as I could, and left her.</p>
<p>I had now begun to mount the hills of Epping Forest with a
different phase of human life before and on either side of
me.&nbsp; On the grass were four gipsies and
&ldquo;Rodneys,&rdquo; with dogs lying beside them.&nbsp; In all
appearance they had neither worked nor washed in their lives,
and, as they said, they were &ldquo;too old to learn how
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had not got much further before I was
accosted by a gipsy girl, apparently about fourteen, with a baby
nearly nude, and covered with dirt and filth, draining the
nourishment of life from its dirty mother, who exposed her
breasts without the least shame.&nbsp; She saw that I noticed
her, and without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation asked me if I wanted
my &ldquo;fortune told.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said that she would tell
<a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>it to me
for a trifle.&nbsp; Her father&mdash;to all appearance&mdash;and
brothers stood by, and acting either upon her own instincts or a
wink from them, she said, &ldquo;I see you know it better than I
can tell you;&rdquo; and away she sidled off to attend to her
cocoa-nuts, saying, after a round of swearing at four gipsy
children, &ldquo;I hope you will give my baby a penny;
that&rsquo;s a good gentleman, do, and God will bless you for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had not gone far up the hill before I found myself in
company with a forest ranger; and a rare good-looking fellow he
was.&nbsp; He was a short thickset man, and as round almost as a
prize bullock.&nbsp; He said the gipsies&mdash;so-called
gipsies&mdash;were the plague of his life.&nbsp; They were
squatting about everywhere, breaking the fences and stealing
everything they could lay their hands upon.&nbsp; Before the last
three years there were hundreds of gipsies in the forest, living
by plunder and fortune-telling, and since they had driven them
away, they had settled upon the outskirts of the forest and
pieces of waste land, some of which were rented by some of the
better class gipsies, and relet again to the other gipsies at a
small charge per week, who thus escaped the law.&nbsp; This good
ranger said there were no real gipsies at the present time in the
country.&nbsp; They had been mixed up with other vagabonds that
scarcely a trace of the genuine gipsy was left.</p>
<p>Some old gipsies were complaining very much because the price
of cocoa-nuts had been raised.&nbsp; &ldquo;Until now,&rdquo;
said this lot of vagabond gipsies, &ldquo;we could get cocoa-nuts
at one pound per hundred; now we are, to-day, giving thirty
shillings per hundred; and it is no joke when you get some of
those old cricketers at work among them.&nbsp; They bowl them off
like one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you do in such
a case?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, sometimes we let them
go on till they get a belly-full, and sometimes we cries quits,
and will have no more on &rsquo;em, and tell them to go somewhere
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>else, we
are quite satisfied.&nbsp; You know, sir, better than I can tell
you that it is no joke to have your nuts bowled off like
that.&nbsp; I feel sometimes,&rdquo; said one gipsy, with
clenched fist raised almost to my face and closed teeth,
&ldquo;that I should like to bowl their yeds off, and no
mistake.&nbsp; I feel savage enough to punch their een out, and I
could do it in a jiffy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He now left me and bawled
out, &ldquo;Now, gents, try your luck, try your luck; all bad uns
returned.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a brisk trade, and a lot of
shoeless, dirty little gipsy children were scrambling after the
balls, and throwing to the winners the nuts they had won; every
now and then there would be a terrible row over a
nut&mdash;whether it was properly hit, or who was the rightful
owner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bang&rdquo; went a ball from a big fellow
against a cocoa-nut, sending it and the juice inside flying in
all directions, and the youngsters scrambling after the
pieces.&nbsp; And then there would be another bawl out by a gipsy
woman, &ldquo;Bowl again, gentlemen; try your luck, try your
luck; all good uns and no bad uns; bad uns returned.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I left this lot of gipsies to pursue my way to the &ldquo;Robin
Hood,&rdquo; where there was a pell-mell gathering of all sorts
of human beings numbering thousands.&nbsp; In elbowing my way
through the crowd, a sharp, business-kind of a gipsy-woman, well
dressed and not bad looking, eyed me over, and, thinking that I
was &ldquo;Johnny&rdquo; from the country, said to a woman who
was near her, &ldquo;You keep back, I mean to tell this gentleman
his fortune.&rdquo;&nbsp; Three or four steps forward she took,
and then stood full in front of me.&nbsp; &ldquo;A fine day,
sir,&rdquo; said the gipsy woman with a twinkle in her eye and a
side laugh, nudging to another gipsy woman at her elbow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, a very fine day,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; She now drew a
little nearer, and said in not very loud tones, &ldquo;Would you
like to have your fortune told you, my good gentleman?&nbsp; I
could tell you something that would please you, I am sure.&nbsp;
There is good luck in your face.&nbsp; Now, <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>my dear good
gentleman, do let me tell your fortune.&nbsp; You will become
rich and have many friends, but will have many false friends and
enemies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Just as she was beginning to spin her yarn
one of the B&mdash; gipsies came up.&nbsp; She was dressed in a
glaring red Scotch plaid dress, with red, blue, green, and yellow
ribbons flying about her head and shoulders; and in her arms was
a baby which was dressed in white linen and needlework.&nbsp;
This gipsy woman was stout, dark, and with round features, her
black hair was waved like I have seen the manes of horses, and
her eye the opposite of heavenly.&nbsp; She now turned to the
gipsy woman who had accosted me and said, &ldquo;Mrs. Smith, you
need not tell this gentleman his fortune, he knows more than we
both can tell him.&nbsp; This is Mr. Smith of Coalville, he had
tea with us at K&mdash;.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the
gipsy woman named Smith, &ldquo;this is Mr. Smith of Coalville,
is it?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard a deal about him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
go, or he&rsquo;ll be putting me in a book.&nbsp;
Goodbye.&rdquo;&nbsp; She put out her hands to shake mine, and
then vanished out of my sight, and I never saw her again in the
forest during the day.&nbsp; I suppose she fancied that I should
be bringing her to book for fortune-telling.&nbsp; I was now left
with the gipsy B&mdash; and her baby.&nbsp; She threw aside her
shawl in order that I might look at the child, who was apparently
about four months old.&nbsp; Poor thing! it did not know that it
was the child of sin, for its parents were living in adultery, as
nearly all the gipsies do.&nbsp; This gipsy woman was earning
money for herself, and an idle man she was keeping, by exhibiting
her illegitimate offspring and telling silly girls their
fortunes.&nbsp; Think about it lightly as we may, fortune-telling
is vastly on the increase all over the country, producing most
deadly and soul-crushing results.&nbsp; Just as I was touching
the poor baby&rsquo;s face and putting sixpence in its hand, a
gentleman connected with the Ragged School Union came up with <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>his two
children.&nbsp; I found as we travelled up the hill together that
I was talking to Mr. Curtiss, the organizing secretary of the
Union, who was in the forest for an &ldquo;outing,&rdquo; and
could, no doubt, with Dr. Grosart say&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I wonder not, when &rsquo;mong the fresh,
glad leaves,<br />
I hear the early spring-birds sing;<br />
I wonder not that &rsquo;neath the sunny eaves<br />
The swallow flits with glancing wing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we reached the top of the hill, I took a sharp turn to
the left, and bid him and his two interesting sons goodbye.</p>
<p>I had not wandered far before I came upon a group of gipsy
children, ragged, dirty, and filthy in the extreme.&nbsp; One of
them ran after me for some &ldquo;coppers.&rdquo;&nbsp; I took
the opportunity of having a chat with the poor child, whose
clothes seemed to be literally alive with vermin.&nbsp; I asked
him what his name was, and his answer was, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know, I&rsquo;ve got so many names; sometimes they call me Smith,
sometimes Brown, and lots of other names.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you ever been washed in your life?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not that I know on, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; The feet of the poor
lad seemed to have festering holes in them, in which there were
vermin getting fat out of the sores, and the colour of his body
was that of a tortoise, except patches of a little lighter yellow
were to be seen here and there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you ever say your
prayers?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, sir, sometimes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you say when you say your prayers?&nbsp; Who
teaches you them?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My sister,&rdquo; said the
boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me the first line and I will give you a
penny.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot, I&rsquo;ve forgotten them;
and so has my sister.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you
read?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Were you ever
in a school?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you
ever hear of Jesus?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I never heard of such a
man.&nbsp; He does not live upon this forest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where does God live?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know; I never heard of him neither.&nbsp; There used to be a chap
live in the forest named like it, <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>but he&rsquo;s been gone away a long
time.&nbsp; I think he went a &lsquo;hoppin&rsquo; in Kent two or
three years ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this juncture a Sunday-school
teacher connected with College Green Chapel, Stepney, whom I
knew, came up, and we entered into conversation together.&nbsp;
The poor lad said he had not had anything to eat &ldquo;since
Saturday.&rdquo;&nbsp; My young friend gave him some sandwiches,
and I gave him some &ldquo;coppers,&rdquo; and we separated.</p>
<p>An old gipsy woman appeared upon the scene with two little
ragged gipsy children at her heels and a long stick in her hand,
reminding me of the &ldquo;shepherd&rsquo;s crook.&rdquo;&nbsp;
On her feet were two odd, old, and worn-out navvy&rsquo;s boots
stuffed with rags, pieces of which were trailing after her
heels.&nbsp; Her dress&mdash;if it could be called
dress&mdash;was short, and almost hung in shreds; crooked and
disgustingly filthy, she strutted about telling fortunes.&nbsp; I
said to the old hypocrite, &ldquo;How old are you? you must be
getting a good round age.&rdquo;&nbsp; With a quivering lip,
trembling voice, and a tottering limb and stick she replied,
&ldquo;If it please the Lord, I shall be seventy-five
soon.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Which tribe of the gipsies do you
belong to?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I belong to the
Drapers.&rdquo;&nbsp; She now altered the tone of her voice to
that of earnestness and said, &ldquo;My good gentleman, I hope
you have got a penny for me; I&rsquo;ve had nothing to eat
to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her voice began to quaver again, and,
looking up towards the bright blue sky, &ldquo;Now, my dear good
gentleman, please do give me a penny, and the Lord will bless
you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had a large family&mdash;nineteen children,
and only three are dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;What will
you charge me for telling me my fortune?&rdquo;&nbsp; She seemed
a different woman in a minute, and replied in sharp tones,
&ldquo;You know it better than I can tell you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
old gipsy woman fancied that she &ldquo;smelt a rat,&rdquo; and
she turned away, with some hellish language to the little
gipsies, and was lost among the crowd of holiday-makers passing
backwards and forwards, <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>drinking, swearing, gambling,
fighting, racing, frolicsome, funny, and thoughtful.&nbsp; The
curtain was now drawn, and I left her to pursue her satanic work
among the simple, gay, and serious.</p>
<p>For a few minutes I stood in meditation and wonder, while the
crowds of gipsies were pursuing their work in fortune-telling and
at the swings, cocoa-nuts, donkey-riding, steam horses,
&amp;c.&nbsp; One young fellow I saw among the gipsies was not of
gipsy birth or gipsy extraction.&nbsp; It was quite evident from
his manner and tattered, black cloth dress, that the young man
was nearly at the bottom of a slippery inclined plane.&nbsp; His
figure brought to me a familiar scene of some twenty-five years
ago, and with which I was well acquainted.&nbsp; The young man
reminded me of the only son of a Methodist local preacher who had
had the sole management of extensive earthenware works in the
&mdash; for a long term of years, and was highly respected in the
district.&nbsp; The young man had been petted and almost
idolized.&nbsp; This only son was highly educated, and in every
way was being prepared to take his father&rsquo;s place at the
works some day.&nbsp; His sisters worked carpet slippers for him,
and his mother warmed them before he went to bed; and
&ldquo;good-nights&rdquo; were given in the midst of loving
embraces, prayers, and kisses.&nbsp; Oftentimes they were given
and said while tears of thankfulness to God for having given
them, as they thought, a son who was to give them comfort,
solace, and pride as they toddled down the hill together, while
the shades of evening gathered round them.&nbsp; Every one in
this Christian household thought no labour in winter or summer,
night or day, too much to be bestowed upon their darling
son.&nbsp; Alas! alas! this idolized boy, for whom thousands of
prayers had been offered to Heaven on his behalf, in an evil hour
ceased to pray for himself, and took the wrong turning or
&ldquo;sharp round to the left,&rdquo; and the last I heard <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>of him was
that he had fallen in with a gang of gipsies, ended his days as a
vagabond in a union in Yorkshire, and had brought his parents
with their early grey hairs in sorrow to the grave.&nbsp; His
loving sisters to-day are scattered to the winds.&nbsp; These
recollections brought tears to my eyes and a deep, deep sigh from
the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>I hung down my head, for I thought by the smarting of my eyes
they would tell a tale, and made my way on foot in the midst of
clouds of dust to Chingford, at the edge of the Forest, where
Easter Monday was being held in high glee.&nbsp; Among the
people, gentle and simple, I met on my way was a cartload of
drunken lads and screaming wenches being drawn to the
&ldquo;Robin Hood&rdquo; and High Beech by a poor, bony, grey,
old, worn-out pony, with knees large enough for two horses, owing
to its many falls upon the hard stones without the option of
choice.&nbsp; If it had not been that it had a load of donkeys
and little live beer barrels with their vent pegs drawn, filling
the air on this bright spring morning with</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t go home till morning,<br />
We won&rsquo;t go home till morning,<br />
Till daylight doth appear,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it might have turned round and bawled out, &ldquo;Am not I
thine ass?&rdquo;&nbsp; Unfortunately for the poor dumb animal
there was no one in its load that had sense, except in response
to a policeman&rsquo;s cudgel, to understand the meaning of
&ldquo;Am not I thine ass?&rdquo;&nbsp; And away it hobbled and
limped till it was out of sight.&nbsp; By this time perhaps the
poor thing has been made into sausages, and sold to the
&ldquo;poor&rdquo; as a rich treat for Sunday only.</p>
<p>One of this load of young sinners stood up in their
midst&mdash;or I should say was propped up&mdash;and, with his
hat slouching backward in his neck, shouted, &ldquo;Mates,
let&rsquo;s give three cheers for Epping Forest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; they cried out, &ldquo;Hip, hip, hurrah!
hip, hip, hurrah!&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Another bawled out,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give three cheers for Easter
Monday.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Bravo, Jack; that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;
shouted a third, as he lay &ldquo;all of a heap&rdquo; at the
bottom of the cart.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hip, hip, hurrah! hip, hip,
hurrah! hip, hip, hip&mdash;&rdquo; but they could not in this
trial of strength get any farther.&nbsp; The &ldquo;hurrah&rdquo;
was left for another Easter Monday.&nbsp; By this time, owing to
the fumes of the beer barrel and the jolting of the cart, they
had become such a &ldquo;set out as I never did see.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Out of this pell-mell cartload of sin one of the crew, who needed
a &ldquo;slobbing bib,&rdquo; cried out, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I
say, Bill, let&rsquo;s give three cheers for your old
cat.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You fool, we have no old cat,&rdquo;
said Bill.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you had.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You did.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; said Bill.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you say so
again, I&rsquo;ll punch you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Punch
away,&rdquo; said Bill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop till we get to the
&lsquo;Robin Hood,&rsquo; and then I&rsquo;ll show you
who&rsquo;s master.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sit down, you
fool,&rdquo; said Bill; &ldquo;you have not the heart of a
chicken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Royal Road and Connaught Lake were beheld and passed over,
and now, after observing and star-gazing right and left, I was
among the gipsies to the left of the Forest Hotel.&nbsp; There
was no mistaking them; for some of the poor women with their
babies in their arms showed the usual signs of having been in the
&ldquo;wars,&rdquo; by exhibiting here and there a &ldquo;black
eye;&rdquo; and without any signs of the maiden and virgin
modesty, romantic, backwood gipsy writers, who have never visited
gipsy wigwams, say is one of the peculiar traits of gipsy
character.&nbsp; Here there were droves of gipsies of all shades,
caste, and colour, shouting, fighting, swearing, lying, and
thieving to their heart&rsquo;s content, with hordes of children
exhibiting themselves in most disgusting positions in the midst
of the boisterous laughter of their beastly parents.</p>
<p>At one of the cocoa-nut stalls stood a big, fat, coarse gipsy
woman with black hair, big mouth, and a bare bosom.&nbsp; Hanging
at one of her breasts was a poor baby, <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>as thin as a herring, and with
festering sores all over its face and body.&nbsp; To me they
seemed to be the outcome of starvation, poverty, neglect, and
dirt.&nbsp; The woman said that &ldquo;teething&rdquo; was the
sole cause of the sores.&nbsp; This poor child ought to have been
nourished in bed instead of being on its way to the grave, which
may be at the back of some bush in the Forest, as I am told has
been the case with numbers of gipsy children before.&nbsp;
Hundreds, and I might say thousands, of them have been born among
the low bushes, furze, and heather on Epping Forest without a
tithe of the care which is bestowed upon cats and puppies.&nbsp;
If children have been and are still being ushered into the world
in such an unceremonious manner, it may be taken for granted that
they have been and still are ushered out of the world &ldquo;when
they are not wanted&rdquo; in an equally unceremonious
manner.&nbsp; Queer things come to my ears sometimes.&nbsp; Gipsy
morality, cleanliness, faithfulness, honesty, and industry exist
only in moonshine&mdash;with some noble exceptions&mdash;and in
the brain of some backwood romantic gipsy novelists, who have
more than once been bewitched by the guile of gipsydom
detrimental to their own interests and the welfare of our
country.&nbsp; A &ldquo;witching eye&rdquo; has blindfolded
hundreds to the putrifying mass of gipsyism; and a gipsy&rsquo;s
deceitful tongue has thrown thousands of
&ldquo;simple-minded&rdquo; off their guard, and left them to
flounder, struggle, and die in the mud of sin, with a future hope
worse than that of a dog.</p>
<p>A tall fellow, almost like two six feet laths nailed together,
now came near, and began to abuse the poor woman in a most
fearful manner for having been away from the cocoa-nut stall
attending to the needs of her child.&nbsp; The swearing was most
blood-curdling and horrifying.&nbsp; I left this establishment to
witness the cruel treatment the poor donkeys were receiving at
the hands of these vagabond gipsies, which is almost beyond
description.&nbsp; <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>The thrashing, kicking, and striking with sharp pointed
sticks, to make the poor donkeys go faster with their loads of
big and little children on their backs, were enough to make
one&rsquo;s hair stand on end.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>I now turned from this scene of human depravity to the Forest
Hotel to recruit my inner man; this, after half an hour waiting,
was accomplished in a gipsy fashion, and with much
scrambling.&nbsp; While entering a few notes in my book, a
gentleman, apparently of position and education, wheeled up on
his tricycle opposite to my window.&nbsp; He had not long
dismounted, lighted his pipe, and sauntered about for a rest,
before a gipsy woman wanted to make friends with him, I suppose
to tell his fortune.&nbsp; Fortunately he was proof against her
&ldquo;witching eyes,&rdquo; forced smiles, and &ldquo;My dear
good gentleman,&rdquo; and turned away from her in disgust.&nbsp;
She did not understand rebuffs and scowling looks, and went away
with her forced smile of gipsydom hanging upon her lips and in
her eyes among the crowd to try her &ldquo;practised&rdquo; hand
upon some one else not quite so wide-awake as this gentleman upon
the tricycle.</p>
<p>A lively change was soon manifest.&nbsp; Dancing among a
pother of dust was to be seen in earnest opposite the hotel
windows, by a most motley crowd.&nbsp; Fat and thin, tall and
lean, young and old, pretty and plain, lovely and ugly, danced
round and round till they presented themselves, through sweat and
dust, fit subjects for a Turkish bath.&nbsp; The old and fat
panted, the young laughed, the giddy screamed, and the thin
jumped about as nimble as kittens, and on they whirled towards
eternity and the shades of long night.</p>
<p>I now retraced my steps along the Royal Road to the
&ldquo;Robin Hood,&rdquo; and while doing so I tried to gather,
from various sources, the probable number of gipsies, young and
old, in Epping Forest on Easter Monday.&nbsp; <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Sometimes I
counted, at other times I asked the royal verderers, gipsies,
show people, and others; and, putting all things together, I may
safely say that there were thirty gipsy women who were telling
fortunes, four hundred gipsy children, and two hundred men and
women, not half a dozen of whom could tell A from B.&nbsp; Most
of the children were begging, and some few were at the
&ldquo;cocoa-nuts.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some idea of the gipsy population
in and around London may be formed from this estimate, when it is
taken into account that holiday festivals were being held on the
outskirts of London at the same time, and in all
directions.&nbsp; Upon Wanstead Flats, Cherry Island, Barking
Road, Canning Town, Hackney Flats, Hackney Marshes, Battersea,
Wandsworth, Chelsea, Wardley Street, Notting Hill, and many other
places, there must be fully 8000 gipsy children, nearly the whole
of whom are illegitimate, growing up as ignorant as heathens,
without any prospect of improvement or a lessening of
numbers.</p>
<p>I had now arrived again at the High Beech and the &ldquo;Robin
Hood,&rdquo; and found myself jostled, crushed, and crammed by a
tremendous crowd of people.&nbsp; Publicans, fops, sharps, and
flats, mounted upon all manner of steeds, varying in style and
breed from &ldquo;Bend Or&rdquo; to the poor broken-kneed pony
owned by a gipsy, were coming cantering, galloping, and trotting
to the scene.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is all this about?&rdquo; I said
to &ldquo;Jack <i>Poshcard</i>,&rdquo; my old friend the gipsy,
who stood at my elbow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know,
governor?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are going to have a
deer turned out directly, and these are the huntsmen, and pretty
huntsmen they are, for I could run faster myself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
While the preparations were going on my friend Jack said to me,
&ldquo;Governor, if you will come up again some Sunday I will see
that you have a fine hare to take back with you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
While we were talking a hare showed its white tail among the
bushes on the side of the hill, and <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>I fancied I heard Jack smacking his
lips at this treat in store for him.</p>
<p>There was a tremendous move forward taking place.&nbsp; The
deer was turned out, and these London <i>quasi</i>-huntsmen were
after it as fast as their steeds could carry them, dressed in
fashions, colours, and shapes, varying from that of a gipsy to a
dandy cockney, holloaing and bellowing like a lot of madcaps from
Bedlam and Broadmoor, after a creature they could neither catch,
kill, cook, nor eat.</p>
<p>While the din and hubbub were echoing away among the lovely
hills and valleys of the forest, I wended my way to the station
and to Victoria Park in company, part of the way, with some
policemen jostling some youths off to the police station for
disgraceful assaults upon young girls.</p>
<p>I strolled in Victoria Park, in company with a friend, the
Rev. R. Spears, but no discord nor discordant noises were to be
seen or heard.</p>
<p>The Sunday-school children had been enjoying themselves to
their heart&rsquo;s content.&nbsp; The grass, in many places, was
literally covered with sandwich papers; and here and there a
group of Sunday-school teachers were resting after their hard
day&rsquo;s work to please and amuse the &ldquo;little
folks&rdquo; in their friskings and gambols in the fresh
air.&nbsp; All this brings to my mind most vividly the long term
of years when I had had the charge of such interesting
gatherings, with their enchanting singing, sweet voices, pleasant
faces, and delightful chatter as the little ones danced and
bounded to and fro around me with mesmeric influence too powerful
to withstand; and at times I have felt an irresistible impulse
prompting me to shout out, &ldquo;God bless the
children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had now arrived at the park-keeper&rsquo;s gate on my way
home.&nbsp; The fogs were rising, the shades of evening <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>were
gathering around us, silence and solitude were stealing over the
scene, and behind me were four young men singing, feelingly, as
they followed me out of the park, in the old evening song
tune&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Swift to its close ebbs out life&rsquo;s
little day,<br />
Earth&rsquo;s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;<br />
Change and decay in all around I see,<br />
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which I said, Amen and Amen.&nbsp; &ldquo;So mote it
be.&rdquo;</p>

39</span>Rambles among the Gipsies upon Wanstead Flats.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Easter</span> Tuesday was cold,
disagreeable, and damp.&nbsp; A London fog was hanging overhead
as I turned early out of my lodgings to visit Wanstead Flats
gipsy fair.&nbsp; Between the black fog and the rays of the sun a
struggle seemed to be taking place as to which influence should
rule London for the day, by imparting either darkness, gloom, and
melancholy, or light, brightness, and cheerfulness to the
millions of dwellers and toilers in London streets, shops,
offices, garrets, cellars, mansions, and palaces.&nbsp; The
struggle did not continue long.&nbsp; Fog and mist had to vanish
into thin air at the bidding of the Spring sun&rsquo;s rays, and
black particles of soot had to drop upon the pavement to be swept
into the London sewers by scavengers.&nbsp; For my own part I
felt heavy all day through fog and sunshine.</p>
<p>I duly arrived at Forest Gate, and began to wander among the
gipsies, &ldquo;taking stock,&rdquo; and indulging in other
preliminaries before making a practical &ldquo;survey&rdquo; of
the whole.</p>
<p>During my peregrinations among the Wanstead Gonjos,
Poshpe&eacute;rdos, Romani-chals, and Romany Ryes, I came <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>upon a
gentleman with whom I had a long interesting conversation about
the best means, plans, and modes of dealing with our little
street Arabs and other juveniles who have &ldquo;gone
wrong,&rdquo; or are found in paths leading to it.&nbsp; From my
friend I gleaned some interesting information relating to the
early steps taken to bring them back into paths of honesty,
industry, and uprightness.&nbsp; Mary Carpenter, of Bristol,
worked hard, long, and successfully in this direction.&nbsp;
Although she has passed away, the fruits of her labour are seen
at Bristol and at other places in the country to-day, and will
continue green till the last trumpet shall sound, and we are
called home to live in an atmosphere where there is no sorrow,
crying, wretchedness, poverty, misery, or death, and where gipsy
and canal children&rsquo;s rags will be transformed into angel
robes, and their dirt and filth into angel brightness and
seraphic splendour.</p>
<p>About a century ago, an institution was set on foot in the
Borough of Southwark called the Philanthropic Society, date 1780,
which provided a home for the children of prisoners, who would
otherwise have been thrown upon the world to beg or steal as best
they could.&nbsp; For a period of more than half a century, the
benevolent character of the society secured for it a fair share
of voluntary support from the public.&nbsp; For many years it
gathered together and educated both boys and girls&mdash;some of
whom were gipsy children.&nbsp; The former were taught trades,
such as tailoring, shoe-making, and rope-making.&nbsp; The girls
were taught laundry work and the duties of domestic life.&nbsp;
It was found, however, by much experience, sometimes painful,
that the presence of both sexes, although kept as separate as
possible, was not advantageous, and therefore, early in the
present century, boys only were received.&nbsp; These were
non-criminals themselves&mdash;only the offspring of that class,
and destitute.</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>When
separate prisons were found necessary for the more successful
reclaiming, as it was hoped, of juvenile offenders, Parkhurst
prison in the Isle of Wight was used for that class.&nbsp; The
experiment of keeping young criminals together and away from
older ones was considered so far satisfactory that, in the year
1846, Sir George Grey, as Home Secretary, resolved&mdash;no doubt
at the instigation of Mary Carpenter, and as the result of her
agitation in this direction&mdash;on trying the experiment of
relieving the pressure arising from increased numbers by drafting
those who had the most reliable characters into an institution
from which they might hope to have more liberty, and ultimately,
by continued good conduct, be placed out in service, and so
obtain their freedom.&nbsp; All the inmates of Parkhurst prison
were under sentence of seven or ten years&rsquo;
transportation.&nbsp; The Home Secretary had twenty-five of those
young persons selected, and a conditional pardon from the Queen
was obtained for each, that they might be placed in circumstances
to work their way speedily to freedom.&nbsp; The buildings of the
Philanthropic Society in Southwark were selected for the
experiment, and those juvenile criminals were introduced to their
new liberty, and associated with the non-criminal boys then in
the Institution.&nbsp; By that action the society changed its
character, and henceforth it became a Reformatory School, still
retaining its original name.</p>
<p>The experiment was both bold and wise; and to insure success
an entire change of management was required.&nbsp; Up to that
time repression and terror were too much exercised by the
officials who had the care of the inmates.&nbsp; A much more
liberal and enlightened policy was resolved upon, and education
and home training were to be the substitutes.&nbsp; A large
schoolroom was erected on the premises, which were situated
immediately behind the Blind Asylum, and extended from the London
Road on the east <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>to St. George&rsquo;s Road on the west, all enclosed
within high walls, having a large chapel on the south-west
corner, which served for both the inmates of the institution and
the general public.&nbsp; It was of the first importance that in
making this experiment properly qualified persons should be
placed in command.&nbsp; The Rev. Sydney Turner (the favourite
son of Sharon Turner, the historian) was the chaplain.&nbsp; The
head master and house superintendent was selected from St.
John&rsquo;s College, Battersea, and Mr. George John Stevenson,
M.A., was appointed to the responsible position.&nbsp; Both the
chaplain and the head master shared alike the deep sense of the
responsibility involved in the undertaking, as any amount of
failure would have been a disaster to be deplored in many
ways.&nbsp; So that it required a strong resolution on the part
of those officials to secure success.&nbsp; Mr. Stevenson had to
assume the position of father of the family, superintending the
food, clothing, recreation, and education of the inmates.&nbsp; A
new and experienced matron took charge of the domestic
arrangements, and thus, from the very commencement of the new
plans, the inmates were made to share in the comforts designed to
improve their moral and social condition.&nbsp; All the old
<i>r&eacute;gime</i> was abandoned.&nbsp; It had broken down
completely so far as either elevating the inmates or securing
public patronage were concerned.&nbsp; The Government paid for
each of their boys a fixed sum, which supplied the finances
required for working the institution, and a cheerful prospect
opened out from the beginning, which was shared alike by the
officers and those under their care.&nbsp; That some of the more
daring spirits should seek to trespass on the additional liberty
thus afforded them was natural; that some few should give
evidence of their innate desire for wrong-doing was not
surprising.&nbsp; The first who violated their agreement to
obedience soon found that the arrangements made with the police
authorities <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>were such as effectually broke down all their schemes
for hastening their liberty.&nbsp; Five or six of the young
rascals who escaped one Sunday evening just before bedtime were
speedily brought back either by the police or by the
superintendent of the institution early the next day, even when
scattered over the metropolis; this had a very deterring effect
on such efforts in future.&nbsp; They did not believe in what a
writer in &ldquo;The Christian Life&rdquo; says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Obscured life sets down a type of bliss,<br
/>
A mind content both crown and kingdom is;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but rather in what a writer in <i>The Sunday at Home</i> for
1878 says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then while the shadows lingering cloked
us,<br />
Down to the ghostly shore we sped.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who exercised more patience and discretion were allowed
to spend a day with their relatives and to begin to familiarize
themselves with the sweets of liberty; and these, after a few
months&rsquo; experience, were sent out into the world to make a
new start in life in such occupations as they had learned during
their confinement; or those who preferred a seafaring life were
placed in the merchant service.&nbsp; A number of gipsy children,
sad to relate, have found their way into our present-day
reformatories, industrial schools, and like places.</p>
<p>When at Bristol in 1882, inspecting along with a number of
ladies and gentlemen the training ship, the superintendent
pointed out to me several little gipsies who had been placed
under his charge to become either &ldquo;men or mice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first year&rsquo;s experience was of the most gratifying
character.&nbsp; The Home Secretary, the Earl of Carlisle, the
Bishop of Oxford, and other distinguished persons, visited the
institution; and, desiring to become acquainted with the details
of the daily experience, sought an interview <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>with Mr.
Stevenson, on whom depended mainly the results of the
experiment.&nbsp; The effect of those personal investigations was
shown by the too early dispatch of a much more numerous company
of young transports from Parkhurst.&nbsp; The design was to
relieve a heavy pressure felt there; but it had the effect of
increasing the difficulties in the Reformatory School in
Southwark.&nbsp; With the enlarged operations the official staff
had to be increased, and the same superintendence worked out the
same results on a larger scale after a little undue tension on
both mind and body.&nbsp; The young persons reclaimed by that
process found ready openings all over London, and these were
frequently visited by the superintendent during the hours the
inmates were at work.&nbsp; The education, conducted by Mr.
Stevenson and an assistant, did not occupy more than two or three
hours daily, so that handicraft operations might have, as it
required, more time for exercise.</p>
<p>The first reformatory school for young criminals in the
metropolis was, at the end of two years&rsquo; experience, a
marked and decided success.&nbsp; The mental strain on the
superintendent was great and continuous, the duties allowed of no
respite for vacation; but as great and permanent advantages were
hoped for by the Home Government, all connected with the
institution worked for that result, and they had the satisfaction
of seeing it.&nbsp; At the end of two years it was resolved to
give the institution a more agricultural character, after the
example of one established at Mettray, in France, whose founder
visited the Philanthropic, in Southwark, during its new
experience.&nbsp; To carry out that plan the erection of the
Philanthropic Farm School at Red Hill, Reigate, was
undertaken.&nbsp; At that time the trustees of the old endowed
school on Lambeth Green required a head master, and, unsolicited
on his part, Mr. Stevenson was unanimously elected to that
office, visiting only occasionally the new establishment, <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>which
required officers with agricultural experience; and it was
gratifying to him to know that the foundations so broadly laid
were successful on a larger scale in working the permanent
reformation of juvenile criminals out in the open country than
they could possibly be in the crowded metropolis.</p>
<p>The success of this plan for dealing with juvenile criminals
makes it evident that a wise statesmanlike plan of educating the
gipsy children would turn them into respectable and useful
members of society, instead of their growing up to make society
their prey.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>To come back to the gipsies upon the &ldquo;Flats,&rdquo; I
bade my friend good-bye, and began in earnest to carry out the
object of my visit.</p>
<p>I had not been long on the ground&mdash;<i>marshy
flats</i>&mdash;before I saw a young man scampering off to a
tumble-down show with a loaf of bread and two red herrings in his
arms.&nbsp; He had no hat upon his head, and his hair was cut
short.&nbsp; His face was bloated, presenting a piebald
appearance of red, white, and black, with a few blotches into the
bargain.&nbsp; His foolish colouring paint, jokes, and antics had
dyed his skin, stained his conscience, and blackened his
heart.&nbsp; His clothing consisted of part of a filthy ragged
shirt and a pair of patched and ragged breeches.&nbsp; They
looked as if the owner and the tailor were combined in one being,
and that the one who stood before me.&nbsp; The stitches in his
breeches could not have presented a stranger appearance if they
had been worked and made with a cobbler&rsquo;s awl and a
&ldquo;tackening end.&rdquo;&nbsp; His boots in better days might
have done duty in a drawing-room, but were now transformed.&nbsp;
With a laugh and a joke I captured my new friend, and
notwithstanding that he had his dinner in his arms, we entered
into a long chat together.</p>
<p>I soon found out that he was the &ldquo;old fool&rdquo; of the
<a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>show, with
which he was connected, and was known among his fraternity as
&ldquo;Old Bones,&rdquo; although he did not seem to be over
twenty years old.&nbsp; His salary for being the &ldquo;old
fool,&rdquo; young fool, a fool to himself, and a fool for
everybody, was four shillings a week and his &ldquo;tommy,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;grub,&rdquo; which, as he said, was &ldquo;not very
delicious&rdquo; at all times.&nbsp; I asked &ldquo;Old
Bones&rdquo; why he was nicknamed &ldquo;Old Bones.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He said, &ldquo;Because some of our chaps saw me riding upon an
old bony horse one day, with its bones sticking up enough to cut
you through, and the more I wolloped it the more it stuck fast
and would not go.&rdquo;&nbsp; When I heard this, one of the
ditties I know in the days of my child slavery in the brickfield
came up as green as ever&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If I had a donkey and it would not go,<br
/>
Must I wollop it?&nbsp; No, no, no!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Our chaps,&rdquo; said Bones, &ldquo;laughed at
me.&nbsp; I had to dismount and let the brute take its chance;
and from that day I have been named &lsquo;Old
Bones.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very old, am
I?&rdquo; he said, and began to kick about on the ground.&nbsp;
But I would not let him go, for I wanted to learn something of
his antecedents.&nbsp; He had been a gutta percha shoemaker, and
could earn his pound or more per week, but preferred to tramp the
country as an &ldquo;old fool,&rdquo; live on red herrings, dress
in rags, and sleep on straw under the stage.&nbsp; Before he had
quite finished his story, another man, dressed in a suit of
dirty, greasy, seedy-looking, threadbare, worn-out West of
England black cloth, joined us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Old Bones,&rdquo;
after a good shake of the hand, vanished to his show, red
herrings, and &ldquo;quid of baccy,&rdquo; and I was left alone
with my second acquaintance.&nbsp; I was not long in finding out,
according to his statement, that he was a &ldquo;converted
Jew,&rdquo; and had been to the &ldquo;Cape&rdquo; and lost
&pound;5000 in the diamond fields, and had come home <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>to
&ldquo;pull up&rdquo; again, instead of which, he had gone from
bad to worse, and was now tramping the country with an old
showman as a &ldquo;fire king,&rdquo; and sleeping under the
stage among old boxes, rags, and straw.&nbsp; His real name was
&mdash;, but was passing through the world as W&mdash;.&nbsp;
Strange to say, I knew his brother-in-law, who is a leading man
in one of the large English towns.</p>
<p>When I asked the &ldquo;fire king&rdquo; how he liked his new
profession, he said, &ldquo;Not at all; at first it was dreadful
to get into the taste of the paraffin and oil.&nbsp; After you
have put the blazing fusees into your mouth, they leave a taste
that does not mix up very well with your food.&nbsp; Paraffin is
a good thing for the rheumatics.&nbsp; I never have them
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; I questioned him as to the process the mouth
underwent previous to the admission of lighted fusees.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you keep your mouth wet,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;have
plenty of courage, and breathe out freely, the blazing fire will
not hurt you.&rdquo;&nbsp; My new friend had much of a suspicious
cast upon his features; so much so, indeed, that in one of his
tramps from Norwich to Bury St. Edmunds, in one day he was taken
up three times as &ldquo;one who was wanted&rdquo; by the
policeman, for doing work not of an angelic kind.</p>
<p>In a van belonging to the owner of &ldquo;a show of
varieties,&rdquo; there were eight children, besides man, wife,
and mother-in-law.&nbsp; The showman could read, and chatter
almost like a flock of crows; but none of the children, including
several little ones, who assisted him in his performances, could
either read or write, except one or two who had a &ldquo;little
smattering.&rdquo;&nbsp; The showman quite gloried in having
beaten the Durham School Board authorities, who had summoned him
for not sending his children to school, while temporarily
residing in the city.&nbsp; He defied them to produce the Act of
Parliament compelling him as a traveller to send his children to
school.&nbsp; The school <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>authorities had sued him under their
own by-laws, and as they could not produce the Act, he came off
with flying colours.</p>
<p>Business was slack with this showman, and he undertook to
introduce me to all the &ldquo;showmen and shows&rdquo; in the
gipsy fair.&nbsp; Of course, I had only time to visit a few of
the <i>best</i> specimens.&nbsp; The first show, which was to be
a pattern of perfection, was &ldquo;boarded.&rdquo;&nbsp; I must
confess I did not much like the idea of mounting the steps, in
the face of thousands of sightseers, to pass through
&ldquo;fools,&rdquo; jesters, mountebanks, and painted women
dressed in little better than &ldquo;tights,&rdquo; and amidst
the clash of gongs and drums.&nbsp; I kept my back to the crowd,
slouched my cap, buttoned up my coat to the throat, hung down my
head, and crept in to witness one of the &ldquo;Sights of
London.&rdquo;&nbsp; After I had duly arrived inside, I was
introduced to my friends the leading performers, amongst whom
were the smallest huntsman in the world and the youngest
jockey.&nbsp; While we were fraternizing, a row commenced between
two of the leading women connected with the show.&nbsp; Two
travelling showmen&mdash;brothers&mdash;had married two
travelling showwomen&mdash;sisters&mdash;among whom jealousy had
sprung up.&nbsp; Tears and oaths were likely to be followed by
blows sharp and strong and a scattering of beautiful locks of
hair.&nbsp; I seemed to be in a fair way for landing into the
midst of a terrible row between the two masculine sisters, whose
arms and legs indicated no small amount of muscular strength,
while their eyes blazed with mischief.&nbsp; One of the dressed
showmen, an acrobat, came to me and said, that I was not to think
anything of the <i>fracas</i>, the women had had only a little
chip out, they would be sobered down in a little time.&nbsp; The
women came round me with their tale, but I thought it the wisest
plan not to interfere in the matter, and kept &ldquo;mum,&rdquo;
for fear that I might get my bones into trouble.&nbsp; Happily
the policeman <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>appeared upon the scene, and before the curtain dropped,
and the performing pony had finished his antics, I had with my
showman friend made myself scarce.&nbsp; He said he was very
sorry, and apologized for having introduced me to his friends
under such circumstances.&nbsp; I could see he was chopfallen at
the result, as this was a &ldquo;going concern&rdquo; in which
all parties engaged were to be held up to me as paragons of
perfection in the performing and showing business.</p>
<p>My showman friend, according to his own statements, had been
almost everything in the &ldquo;show&rdquo; line, ranging from
that of a tramp to an &ldquo;old fool.&rdquo;&nbsp; To my mind he
was well qualified for either, or anything else in this line of
business, with will strong enough to drag his eight children
after him; at any rate, himself and his large family were going
fast to ruin.</p>
<p>I now visited wax-work shows, and saw the noble heads of the
great and good arranged side by side with those of notorious
murderers and scamps, reminding me very much of what is to be the
lot of all of us in our last resting-place.&nbsp; I had the
opportunity of seeing the greatest horse alive, &ldquo;dog
monkeys,&rdquo; &ldquo;tight-rope dancers,&rdquo; performing
&ldquo;kanigros,&rdquo; &ldquo;white bears,&rdquo; &ldquo;stag
hunt,&rdquo; &ldquo;slave market,&rdquo; &ldquo;working model of
Jumbo,&rdquo; &ldquo;fat women,&rdquo; acrobat dancers, female
jugglers, Indian sack feat, female Blondin, cannon firing, and a
lifeboat to the rescue.&nbsp; My friend wanted his tea, and left
me now to pursue my way as best I could.&nbsp; For a few minutes
I stood and looked at the scene; under the glare of their lamps
actors pulled their faces, performed their megrims, danced their
dances, chuckled, winked, shouted, and rattled their copper and
silver, as the simpletons stepped upon the platform to
&ldquo;step in and take their places before the performance
commenced.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course all the shows in the fair were
not to be classed in the black list.&nbsp; In some of them useful
information and knowledge <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>were to be gained.&nbsp; It was the
debasing surroundings that had such a demoralizing effect upon
the young folks.</p>
<p>Turning from the shows I began again to visit the vans.&nbsp;
In one van owned by a Mr. B. there were a man, woman, and nine
children, four of whom were of school age.&nbsp; The woman had
been a Sunday-school teacher in her early days, but, alas! in an
evil hour, she had listened to the voice of the charmer, and down
she began to travel on the path to ruin, and she is still
travelling with post haste, unless God in His goodness and mercy
hath opened her eyes.&nbsp; She told me that she would have sent
four of the children to school last winter while they were
staying with their van at Brentwood, but the school authorities
would not allow them without an undertaking that the children
should be sent for one year.&nbsp; They were on Chigwell Common
all last winter, and could have sent their children to
school.&nbsp; She said they were often a month in a place, and
would be glad to send the children to school if means were
adopted whereby the children could go as other children go.&nbsp;
None of them except the poor woman could tell a letter.&nbsp; She
had been brought up in a Church of England Sunday school, and
could repeat the creeds, &amp;c.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;I teach the children to say their prayers; but
what use is it among all those bad children and bad folks?&nbsp;
It is like mockery to teach children to pray when all about are
swearing.&nbsp; I often have a good cry over my Sunday
dinner,&rdquo; said the poor woman, &ldquo;when I hear the church
bells ringing.&nbsp; The happy days of my childhood seem to rise
up before me, and my Sunday-school hours, and the sweet tunes we
used to sing seem to ring in my ears.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, come, come to school,<br />
Your teachers join in praises<br />
On this the happy pearl of days;<br />
Oh, come, come away.</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>The
Sabbath is a blessed day,<br />
On which we meet to praise and pray,<br />
And march the heavenly way;<br />
Oh, come, come away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, with a deep-drawn sigh, she said, &ldquo;Ah! they will
never come again; no, never!&nbsp; I should like to meet all my
children in heaven; but with a life like this it cannot, and I
suppose will not be.&rdquo;&nbsp; I gave the children some little
books and some coppers, and then bade her good-bye with a sad and
heavy heart, which I sometimes feel when I witness such sorrowful
sights.&nbsp; Among the crowd of sightseers were, gaudily dressed
in showy colours, a number of &ldquo;gipsy girls,&rdquo; anxious
to tell simpletons &ldquo;their fortunes;&rdquo; and I rather
fancy a goodly number listened to their bewitching tales and
lies.&nbsp; Dr. Donne, in &ldquo;Fuller&rsquo;s Worthies,&rdquo;
says of gipsies&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Take me a face as full of frawde and
lyes<br />
As gipsies in your common lottereyes,<br />
That is more false and more sophisticate<br />
Than our saints&rsquo; reliques, or man of state;<br />
Yet such being glosed by the sleight of arte,<br />
Faine admiration, wininge many a hart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I next came upon a gipsy tent, <i>i.e.</i>, a few sticks stuck
in the ground and partly covered with rags and old
sheeting.&nbsp; The bed in this tent was a scattering of straw
upon the damp, cold ground.&nbsp; Here were a man, woman, and
four children.&nbsp; The woman and children were in a most
pitiable condition.&nbsp; None could tell a letter.&nbsp; One of
the children lay crouched upon a little straw&mdash;and it was a
cold day&mdash;in one corner of the tent.&nbsp; Such a pitiable
object I have never seen.&nbsp; It was very ill; it could not
speak, stand, hear, or eat; and it was terribly emaciated.&nbsp;
If ever sin in this world had blighted humanity, before me lay a
little human being upon whom sin seemed to have poured forth its
direful vengeance without stint or measure.&nbsp; With an aching
heart I deeply sympathized <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>with the gipsy woman and little gipsy
children, whose sad condition is worse than the Rev. Mark Guy
Pearse&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rob Rat,&rdquo; which could scarcely be;
and I did what I could to cheer them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

 src="images/p51s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>I visited a number of tents, and wandered among the poor
children and gipsy dogs that were squatting about in the dark
upon the cold, wet ground.&nbsp; One fine-faced gipsy Lee and his
good gipsy wife have had a family of nineteen children, all of
whom were born on the roadside; most of whom are now grown up and
have large families.&nbsp; It is fearful to contemplate the
number of gipsy wanderers and hedgebottom travellers from this
family who are neither doing themselves or the country any
good.</p>
<p>There were on the &ldquo;Flats&rdquo; at the gipsy fair about
one hundred and thirty families in tents and in vans; and of this
number there would be forty families squatting about with their
lurcher dogs, ready for any kind of game, big or little, black or
white, bound by bars or as free as the air.&nbsp; As a rule a
gipsy&rsquo;s list of game includes, according to Asiatic notions
and ideas, all the eatable live or dead stock in creation that
either he or his dog can lay their hands upon or stick their
teeth into.</p>
<p>There must have been over four hundred gipsy and other
travelling children going without education, and not one could
ever have been in a Sunday school.</p>
<p>It was about 10.30.&nbsp; The mouths and hearts of those who
were left began to breed venomous, waspish words.&nbsp; At any
rate, all the more steady and sensible part of the sightseers
were wending their way homewards.&nbsp; Others were making for
the beershops and public-houses, and the riff-raff were loitering
about for what they could pick up.&nbsp; Policemen seemed to be
creeping upon the ground, buttoned up to the throat, and ready
for any emergency.</p>
<p>A few yards from where I was standing I noticed, by <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>the aid of
gas, naptha, and paraffin, a gipsyish-looking man standing,
opposite one of the cottages, with his arms folded over the
palings.&nbsp; I soon found out that he was a gipsy, but had
recently taken to house-dwelling, and was now engaged in
labourer&rsquo;s work with bricklayers.&nbsp; He invited me into
his comfortably furnished house, and introduced me to his tidy
wife, who was not a gipsy, and two good-looking little
children.&nbsp; I had a few minutes&rsquo; chat with them.&nbsp;
He gave me a short account of the suffering, trials, and
hardships which he endured while tramping the country, and living
in tents, and under vans, and on the roadside.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
early life,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when I was quite a child, I
was placed with my uncle, who is a gipsy horsedealer, to live
with him and my aunt, in their van.&nbsp; For a time they behaved
well to me, and I slept in the van at nights.&nbsp; From some
cause or other, which I have never been able to make out, I was
sent to sleep under the van with the dogs&rsquo;, and to lie upon
straw with but little covering.&nbsp; My food now was such as I
could pick up&mdash;turnips, potatoes, or any mortal thing that I
could lay my hands upon.&nbsp; In the winter time I have had to
gnaw and nibble a cold turnip for my dinner like a sheep.&nbsp; I
used to have to run about in all weathers to do the dirty work of
my uncle, mind his horses, ponies, and donkeys in the lanes and
fields, for which he would not give me either food, clothing, or
lodgings, other than what I looked out for myself.&nbsp; My
clothing I used to beg, and, when once put upon my back, there
they stuck till they dropped off by pieces.&nbsp; I had a hard
time of it for many years, I can tell you, and no mistake.&nbsp;
My uncle is now a gentleman horsedealer, and keeps his carriage
and his servants to wait upon him.&nbsp; He is well known in
London.&nbsp; If he meets or sees me in the streets he turns his
head another way, and won&rsquo;t look at me, though I helped to
make his fortune.&nbsp; Every dog has its day, and <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>my turn may
come.&nbsp; We gave up drink, and I go to the church and chapel
when I have the chance, and I am all the better for it, thank
God.&nbsp; I may be as well off as my cruel old uncle some
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; I shook hands with this gipsy family, and bade
them God speed, and turned again into the fair and among the
gipsy tents.&nbsp; Some of the gipsy and other travelling
children were running about picking up scraps and crumbs that had
fallen from the bad man&rsquo;s table.&nbsp; Every piece of paper
that had the appearance of having been folded up was eyed over
with eager curiosity and wonder by the poor little urchins before
they would believe that it was full of emptiness.</p>
<p>The women were putting the little gipsies to bed, and their
evening prayers in many cases were oaths.&nbsp; They had never
been taught to lisp the evening prayer&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bless Thy little lamb to-night;<br />
Through the darkness be Thou near me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep me safe till morning light.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They threw off their outer garments, rolled under some old,
dirty, filthy rags at one end of their little tent, crouching
together like so many pigs, and snoozed and snored away till
morning, except when they were trampled upon or wakened by their
drunken gipsy parents.&nbsp; It is horrible to think that not one
of this number, between six and seven hundred men, women, and
children&mdash;so far as I have been able to make out&mdash;ever
attended a place of worship on Sundays, or offered a prayer to
God at eventide.&nbsp; Sin! sin! wretchedness, misery, and
degradation from the year&rsquo;s beginning to the year&rsquo;s
end!&nbsp; Would to God that a comet from His throne, as they sit
under the starlight of heaven, would flash and flash upon their
mental vision till they asked themselves the question,
&ldquo;Whither are we bound?&rdquo;&nbsp; Christian England!</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>&ldquo;Up! a great work lies before you,<br />
Duty&rsquo;s standard waveth o&rsquo;er you.</p>
<p>Stretch a hand to save the sinking<br />
Carried down sin&rsquo;s tide unthinking.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The pangs of hell,&rdquo; as the Rev. C. H. Spurgeon
says in the <i>Christian Herald</i>, March 31, 1880, &ldquo;do
not alarm them, and the joys of heaven do not entice them&rdquo;
to do their duty.&nbsp; With tears of blood I would say, Oh that
the voice of Parliament and the action of the Government were
seen and heard taking steps to educate the poor gipsy children,
so that they may be enabled to read and repeat prayers&mdash;even
if their parents have lost parental regard and affection for
their own offspring.</p>
<p>The business of the day was now over, and it was evident that
the time had arrived for &ldquo;paying off old
scores.&rdquo;&nbsp; The men and women had begun to collect
together in groups.&nbsp; Murmurings and grumblings were
heard.&nbsp; The tumult increased, and presently from one group
shouts of &ldquo;Give it him, Jock&rdquo; were echoing in the
air, disturbing the stillness of the night.&nbsp; Thumps, thuds,
and shrieks followed each other in rapid succession.&nbsp; I
closed in with the bystanders.&nbsp; Blood began to flow from the
&ldquo;millers,&rdquo; who looked murderously savage at each
other.&nbsp; Thus they went on &ldquo;up and down Welsh
fashion&rdquo; for a few minutes, till one gipsy woman cried out,
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s broken Jock&rsquo;s nose, a beast
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The policeman came now quietly along as if his
visit would have done on the morrow.&nbsp; One woman shouted out,
&ldquo;Bobby is coming, now it is all over.&rdquo;&nbsp; To me it
looked as if &ldquo;Bobby&rdquo; did not like the job of quelling
gipsy rows; if he had to quell them it would seem that he had
rather they let off some of the steam got up by revenge, spite,
and beer before he tackled them.</p>
<p>While this gang of gipsies were separating, another row was
going on near to a large public-house, to which I <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>hastened, and
arrived in time to see one of them &ldquo;throw up the
sponge.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were no less than half a dozen fights
in less than half an hour.&nbsp; It was now half-past eleven, and
I began to think that it was quite time that I looked out for my
night&rsquo;s lodging, so I entered into council with the
policeman.&nbsp; We visited eating-houses, coffee-houses,
lodging-houses, public-houses, and shops in Forest Gate without
success.&nbsp; The policeman advised me to walk to
Stratford.&nbsp; This I could not do, for I began to feel rather
queer and giddy; my only prospect was either to pass the night at
the station, on the &ldquo;Flats,&rdquo; or return by the last
train.&nbsp; No time was to be lost.&nbsp; I hastily took my
ticket, and almost rolled and tumbled down the steps and into the
train, which took me to Fenchurch Street Station, in a somewhat
bewildered state as to my next move forward.&nbsp; For a minute
or two I stood still, lost in wonder.&nbsp; The policeman soon
appeared on the scene with his &ldquo;Please move on&rdquo; and
gruff voice.&nbsp; I told him I wanted to &ldquo;move on,&rdquo;
if he would tell me where to move to.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
are,&rdquo; answered the policeman, &ldquo;plenty of shops to
move into in London, if that is what you mean.&nbsp; It depends
what sort of shop you want.&nbsp; If you have got plenty of
money, there is the &lsquo;Three Nuns.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; And he
also pointed out one or two other first-class places in
Aldgate.&nbsp; I bade the policeman good night, and went across
the street to look at the &ldquo;Three Nuns,&rdquo; which was
being closed for the night.&nbsp; The outside of the place
indicated to me that I should have to dip more deeply into my
pocket than my financial position would allow, and I turned to
look for fresh quarters in Aldgate.&nbsp; It was now past twelve
o&rsquo;clock, and all the places, except one or two, were
closed.&nbsp; On the door of an eating-house and coffee-shop I
espied a light, and thither I went.&nbsp; Fortunately the
servants were about, and the landlady was enjoying her midnight
meal.&nbsp; A bed was promised, and after a <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>long chat
with the landlady and some supper, I was shown into my room, the
appearance of which I did not like; but it was
&ldquo;Hobson&rsquo;s choice, that or none.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
were two locks upon the door, and I had taken the precaution to
have plenty of candles and matches with me.&nbsp; It looked as if
a broken-down gentleman had been occupying it for some time, who
had suddenly decamped, leaving no traces of his
whereabouts.&nbsp; There was but little clothing upon the bed,
and the springs were broken and &ldquo;humpy.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
turned into it to do the best I could till morning.&nbsp; The
smell of the room was that of sin.&nbsp; The rattling about the
stairs during the whole of the night was not of a nature to
produce a soothing sensation.&nbsp; I felt with Charles Wesley,
when he wrote</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God of my life, whose gracious power<br />
Through varied deaths my soul hath led,<br />
Or turned aside the fatal hour,<br />
Or lifted up my sinking head.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would have been helpful if I could have sung out in this
miserable abode, for such it was to me&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My song shall wake with opening light,<br
/>
And cheer the dark and silent night.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tossed about nearly all night, and at seven o&rsquo;clock I
turned out to get an early breakfast, and to make my way back to
&ldquo;Wanstead Flats&rdquo; to have a last peep at my gipsy
friends.&nbsp; I arrived about eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Some of
the show folks and show keepers must have had but little sleep,
for I found them moving off the Flats for a run out to their
country seats, leaving behind them the seeds of sin, sown by
ignorance, fostered by an evil heart, and watered by oaths and
curses.</p>
<p>I turned in to have another chat with my gipsy friends, who
had taken to house-dwelling, and to listen to their pretty little
girl singing as only children can sing</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Whither,
pilgrims, are you going?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>which
caused me to undergo a process of screwing up my feeling, and
winking and blinking to avoid any sign of weakness becoming
visible.</p>
<p>What a blessed future there would be for our gipsies and other
vagabonds, if all their children could sing with tear-fetching
pathos, &ldquo;Whither, pilgrims, are you going,&rdquo; in a way
that would bring their parents often to their knees!</p>
<p>I bade them good-bye, and made my way back to London and
home.&nbsp; I was far from well, and it was fortunate I had sent
word over-night to my wife, asking her to meet me part of the way
from the station, as I was coming by the last train.</p>
<p>The night was dark, very dark and wet, and with a giddy
sensation creeping over me, I stepped out of the train and began
to wend my way home, reeling about like a drunken man.&nbsp; I
staggered and walked fairly well for more than half the distance,
till I felt that I must pull up or I should tumble.&nbsp; For a
few minutes I stood by a gate, my forehead and hands felt as cold
as a lobster, with a clammy sweat upon them.&nbsp; I felt at my
pulse, but the deadness of my fingers rendered them insensible to
the throbbings of the human gauge fixed in our wrists.</p>
<p>Not a star in the heavens was visible to send its little
twinkling cheer.&nbsp; If the bright brilliant guiding lamps of
heaven had receded ten degrees backwards into the dark boundless
space, the heavens could not have been darker.&nbsp; Everything
was as still as death, and I did not seem to be making any
headway at all.&nbsp; Neither sound of man nor horse could be
heard.&nbsp; Oh! how I did wish and pray that somebody would pass
by to give me a lift.&nbsp; I made another start, and had got as
far as a heap of stones on the side of the road, when I felt that
if I were to swoon, or to have a fit, or die, it would be better
to be off the road.&nbsp; I was just going to sit upon the heap
of stones, and <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>had dropped my &ldquo;Gladstone bags,&rdquo; when I
heard the patter of some little feet in the distance.&nbsp; I
pricked up my ears, and shouted out as loud as I could,
&ldquo;Halloo, who&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;&nbsp; The answer came
from my wife and little folks, &ldquo;It is we.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
was steadied home between them, and found to my joy a good fire
and supper awaiting me.&nbsp; I then thanked God for all His
mercies and retired to my couch, feeling as Richard Wilton, M.A.,
felt when he penned the following lines for the <i>Christian
Miscellany</i>, 1882&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Some fruit of labour will remain,<br />
And bending ears shall whisper low,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all in
vain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

60</span>Rambles among the Gipsies at Northampton Races.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the midst of doubts and
perplexities, sometimes inspired with confidence and at other
times full of misgivings, and with my future course completely
hidden from me as if I had been encircled by the blackest
midnight darkness, with only one little bright star to be seen, I
mustered up the little courage left in me; and with great
difficulty and many tears of sorrow and disappointment, I started
by the first train, with as light a load of troubles as possible
under the circumstances, to find my way to Northampton races, to
pick up such facts and information relating to the poor little
gipsy tramps that Providence placed in my way, or I could collect
together.</p>
<p>After the usual jostling, crushing, and scrambling by road and
rail, smoke, oaths, betting, gambling, and swearing, I found
myself seated in a tramcar in company with one gentleman only,
and, strange to say, of the name of &ldquo;Smith,&rdquo; but not
a &ldquo;gipsy Smith,&rdquo; nor a racing &ldquo;Smith,&rdquo; of
whom there are a few; in fact, there are more gipsies of the name
of &ldquo;Smith&rdquo; than there are of any other name.&nbsp; It
may be fortunate or unfortunate <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>for me that I cannot trace my lineage
to a &ldquo;gipsy Smith,&rdquo; and that my birthplace was not
under some hedge bottom, with the wide, wide world as a larder
that never needed replenishing by hard toil.&nbsp; All required
of the &ldquo;gipsy kings&rdquo; of the ditch bank, now as in
days of yore&mdash;so long as the present laws are winked at, and
others intended to reach them are shelved&mdash;is to
&ldquo;rise, kill, and eat,&rdquo; for to-morrow we die, and the
devil take the hindmost.&nbsp; My friend Mr. Smith was left in
the car, and I sped my way upon the course.&nbsp; I had not been
long in wandering about before I was joined by a
respectable-looking old man, who evidently had done his share of
hard work on &ldquo;leather and nails,&rdquo; and was on the
lookout for ease and fresh air during the remainder of his
pilgrimage to the one of two places in store for him.&nbsp; After
a few minutes&rsquo; conversation about the &ldquo;ities&rdquo;
and &ldquo;isms&rdquo; rampant at Northampton, and our various
views upon them, we separated at the edge of the gipsy
encampment, wigwams, squalor, and filth.&nbsp; I took the right
turning&mdash;at least I have no doubt about its proving so in
the long run&mdash;and he took the left turning; and to this day
we have not run against each other again.</p>
<p>The gipsies, <i>Push</i>-gipsies, and Gorgios were hard at
work putting up their tents and establishments, and I in the
meantime walked and trotted the course in a morning&rsquo;s
airing fashion, coming in contact occasionally with a sceptic,
infidel, and freethinker.&nbsp; These were turned away in my
rough fashion, and my wandering racing meditations brought forth
some of the following seeds of thought as I paced backwards and
forwards upon the turf.&nbsp; At any rate they are problems,
maxims, and aphorisms&mdash;such as they are&mdash;that have
appeared before my vision in my gipsy rambles as I have been
working out my gipsy plans, and are, I think, as worthy of a
place here as the misleading gipsy lore and lies we have read and
heard of.&nbsp; <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>Some of these will probably die as they bud into life,
others may keep green for a little time, and there may be a few
that will live and cause a few wanderers to take notes of the
journey:</p>
<p>Little, cramped, and twisted ideas of God are the outcome of
froth and foam, set in motion by thwarted conceit and mortified
vanity.</p>
<p>Vaunted scepticism is the poisonous fungus of decaying minds
and rotten ideas.</p>
<p>Infidelity is hellish divinity gone mad.</p>
<p>Nihilists and Fenians are crawlers, who crawl out of rotten
heaps of wrongs, which the light of day turns into devil-flies,
with fiery hate in their eyes and poisonous stings in their
tails.</p>
<p>Socialists and Communists are the rotten toads of society,
whose love for the country&rsquo;s welfare consists in inflating
themselves till they burst, like the frog in the fable.</p>
<p>Infidels and sceptics are the devil&rsquo;s bats, with one of
their wings cropped shorter than the other.</p>
<p>The froth, foams, and fumes of sceptics and infidels are only
a little hellish mist that temporarily dims our eyeglasses, which
the sun of truth dispels with laughing smiles.</p>
<p>The soft tears of love are the nightly mist-drops of heaven,
which the dawn of the eternity turns into the everlasting
snowdrops of paradise.</p>
<p>Our godly prayers sent heavenward are preserved by our
heavenly Father, and will, on our arrival on the shores of
paradise, become the merry pealing bells of heaven which will
chime through eternal ages.</p>
<p>In the spirit of disobedience there is an unseen power that
can draw down the greatest curse of Heaven.</p>
<p>The spirit of love is a heavenly wand that causes everything
to laugh and dance that comes under its influence.</p>
<p>The spirit of hate is a Satanic rod of such baneful influence
that it withers and kills everything that it touches.</p>
<p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Our
loving, trickling tears of penitence and contrition are being
collected by God to form the pure, transparent streams and rivers
of joy and gladness which are to run through the celestial city;
and those whose lot it has been to shed many upon earth will have
increased happiness in heaven from the fact that they have
contributed more largely to make heaven more beautiful and lovely
by adding to the refreshing streams of paradise.</p>
<p>The prayers of trouble of God&rsquo;s children upon earth are
being reset in heaven to angelic music, which, on our landing
upon the heavenly shores, are to be our songs of joy and
praise.</p>
<p>Selfish, hollow, hypocritical, sleek-tongued deceivers are the
four-faced and four-headed Satanic demons of society.&nbsp; Their
home is among the mud; they can smile in the sunshine; but their
deeds are dirty and poisonous.&nbsp; They are difficult to catch,
but more difficult to hold when caught.</p>
<p>Pop-gun liberality, when it is the outcome of a little, bad
heart, selfishness, and pride, may be compared to bubbles rising
upon putrid waters.&nbsp; In the distance, and with a smiling
sun, the various colours present a beautiful enchanting
appearance; but as you near them the blackness, fitfulness, and
stench is observable, and you turn away disgusted.</p>
<p>A double-headed face without eyes is he who spends a lifetime
in wrecking others to hoard up ill-gotten gold, which, when in
the last extremity and in fear of being wrecked himself, he
throws overboard to some benevolent object, trusting to
God&rsquo;s lovingkindness and tender mercies to turn it into a
lifeboat that will bring him safe to land.</p>
<p>As the sun is the centre of our solar system of heavenly
bodies, giving light to the eleven illuminating planets of
various colours, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Ceres, Pallas,
Juno, Vesta, Jupiter, Saturn, and the <i>Georgium Sidus</i>
moving round it, so in like manner is <span
class="smcap">Love</span> the centre <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>of the heavenly graces, giving light
and beauty to the eleven Christian characteristics, joy, peace,
longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, industry,
honesty, temperance, and chastity.</p>
<p>Every action of retaliation is a bunch of hard prickles, and
it has in the centre of it a wasps&rsquo; nest, and the buzzing
of the wasps can be heard and their stings felt by the
bystanders; while every act of love is a collection of perfumed,
fragrance-scented oils, with a cooing dove on the top as a
guard.</p>
<p>Retaliation and revenge are a dark cave, sending forth
sulphurous fumes and the groans of hell; while forgiveness and
love are a lovely garden of fragrant flowers, with cooing doves
and rippling water-brooks in the midst, sending forth heavenly
music.</p>
<p>As the process of &ldquo;inoculation&rdquo; applied to flowers
gives to us the most beautiful coloured, tinted, edged, and
lovely flowers, so in like manner it is with the Spirit of
Christ.&nbsp; When once the Spirit of Christ is brought into
contact with our human nature, refined sentiment and
feelings&mdash;the Christian graces&mdash;soon become
manifest.</p>
<p>As the wind and storm shake off the fruit which has the least
hold upon the tree, so in like manner it is with the members of
Christian Churches and the State.&nbsp; Those members and
citizens the most careless, loveless, and cold, who have the
least hold upon the Church, God, and the State, storms and
persecution readily bring to the ground.</p>
<p>Death-wishers, with evil hearts, in pursuit of a good man, are
the parents and life-bearers of immortal fame, which will sit
upon the object of their malice, hate, and spite as a crown of
precious jewels; and that which they intended and still intend to
be the arrow of death God has turned and is turning into a tree
of life, ever budding, blossoming, and teeming with endless
delicious fruits.</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>Hope is
the magic Luna of heaven let down and swinging to and fro in
earth by golden cords, which answers to the call of young or old,
rich or poor, wise or simple, learned or ignorant, and transfers
darkness into light, hell into heaven, and devils into
saints.&nbsp; Under its power poverty becomes riches, tears of
sorrow songs of joy, sickness health, and death life.</p>
<p>The last man stands the first on a backward course.</p>
<p>An idle man is the devil&rsquo;s standard-bearer, and works
harder and does more service by his example than any man in the
black force.</p>
<p>The first man who arrives at the top of a hill is the man to
live the longest, see the most, and enjoy the most happiness.</p>
<p>Mysterious actions, according to the intent of the author, are
either the seeds of life or the seeds of death.</p>
<p>As fire and cooking brings out the sweetness of food to make
it digestible, so in like manner the fiery trials of affliction
bring out the sweetness of a Christian character, making his path
through life pleasant, agreeable, and profitable.</p>
<p>Private prayer is the Christian&rsquo;s log, which indicates
the rate he travels towards heaven, and Christlike acts of
benevolence are the log-book in which his speed is
registered.</p>
<p>When a professing Christian dances about among the members of
Christian Churches solely for the sake of trade and filthy lucre,
it may be taken as an indication that he has stuck a broom upon
his masthead, and is open for sale to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>Birds, bees, and wasps pick the finest and sweetest fruit, so
in like manner naughty men, women, and children pick at the
sweetest children of heaven whom God loves and smiles upon.</p>
<p>False, misleading sentiment is the devil&rsquo;s tonic sol-fa,
set to music to suit his hearers.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>To keep
out of fogs is to live on a hill, so in like manner to keep out
of damping thoughts and foggy doubts about God&rsquo;s ways and
doings is to live high up in His favour.</p>
<p>As atmospheric influences round marshy spots, rushy swamps,
and low meadows produce a meteoric light called
&ldquo;Jack-o&rsquo;-Lantern,&rdquo; which in the distance looks
beautiful to outsiders flitting about in the dark, carried by an
unseen hand, but which is dangerous to follow, so in like manner
it is with scientific Christianity apart from the Gospel.</p>
<p>A scientific Christian held up as a light without Christ is a
&ldquo;Will-o&rsquo;-the Wisp&rdquo; Christian.</p>
<p>Fawners and flatterers are like dogs that have worms in their
tails and wag them to strangers; they are not to be trusted.</p>
<p>A backslider is a tree with three parts of the top cut down,
leaving sufficient above ground to serve as a warning to others,
or as a post upon which to hang a gate to prevent others passing
that way.</p>
<p>If a writer wishes to add lustre to his literary fame, he will
best succeed in his purpose by turning &ldquo;French
polisher,&rdquo; instead of becoming a literary thief.</p>
<p>To polish and give artistic touches to a crude cabinet,
bringing out its beauty and defects, showing the knots and grain,
gives credit to the artist; while to run away with the rough and
unpolished jewels it contains, claiming as his own that which
belongs to another, brings disgrace and ruin.</p>
<p>To drive successfully along the crooked and zigzag lanes of
life, time and space must be taken to go round the corners.&nbsp;
Fools can drive along a straight level, but it takes a wise man
to round the down-hill corners without a spill over.</p>
<p>Gilt and crested harness does not improve the quality of a
poor emaciated, bony, half-starved horse; so in like manner a few
Oxford and Cambridge gilt touches put <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>upon a sensual, backwood gipsy
romantic tale, will not improve the condition of our gipsies and
their children.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>My wandering meditation being over, I now drew myself up to a
gipsy &ldquo;grand stand.&rdquo;&nbsp; To all sensible, good men
it appears as a <i>horrible fall</i> rather than the &ldquo;grand
stand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thousands of young men and women, trained by
Christian, godly parents, have been brought to ruin by its rotten
foundation and evil associations.&nbsp; It is a
&ldquo;stand&rdquo; from which men and women can see&mdash;if
they will open their eyes&mdash;the wrath of God, the roads to
destruction, and the &ldquo;course&rdquo; to hell.</p>
<p>My first salutation was from three big grizzly poachers&rsquo;
snaps, a kind of cross between a bloodhound, greyhound, and a
bulldog, that lay at the entrance of a wigwam, in which lay a
burly fellow marked with small-pox, and whose hair was close
shaven off his head and from round his coarse, thick neck.&nbsp;
This specimen of an English gipsy possessed a puggish kind of
nose, a large mouth, and his clothes seemed &ldquo;greasy and
shiny.&rdquo;&nbsp; The woman looked an intelligent, strong kind
of woman, and well fitted, to all appearance, for a better
life.&nbsp; Round a tin pot upon the greensward there were three
other gipsy tramps, kneeling and gnawing meat off a bone like
dogs, with bread by their sides.&nbsp; They did not growl like
dogs, but they showed me their teeth and muttered, and this was
quite sufficient.&nbsp; The occupation of this gang seemed to be
that of attending to a cocoa-nut establishment, the profits of
which, during the races, they had travelled from London by road
in three days to secure.&nbsp; To me it appeared all were fish
that came to their net; and if they did not come of their own
accord, they would not think twice before fetching them.&nbsp;
This gipsy wigwam was the kitchen, drawing-room, dining-room,
bedroom, &amp;c., for four men, one woman, and two big girls, not
one of whom could <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>read and write.&nbsp; The only little gleam of light
which shone from the conversation in this dark abode was when
they referred to some gipsies, who, they said, had been
&ldquo;putting on a pretence of religion in order to fill their
pocket,&rdquo; and they knew one who &ldquo;saved over &pound;800
since he had been religious.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If I must be
religious, I would be religious, and no mistake about it,&rdquo;
said another.&nbsp; At this they began to swear fearfully.&nbsp;
I mentioned several gipsies who had given up their old habits,
and, as I told them, had begun to lead better lives.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; they said, with a vengeance; to which I
answered, &ldquo;By their fruits shall ye know them.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I then shook hands, and wended my way to the next
establishment.&nbsp; This was an old cart covered over entirely
with calico from the ridge to the ground.&nbsp; Connected with
this van there were two men and a boy, who, it seems, are novices
at the cocoa-nut profession.&nbsp; To me it appeared that they
were tired of the hard work and tightness of town life, and were
trying their fortune at gipsying and idle-mongering.&nbsp; On the
course there would be nearly twenty cocoa-nut
&ldquo;saloons.&rdquo;&nbsp; Connected with three of the vans on
the course there were sixteen children and eight men and women,
only one of whom could read and write.&nbsp; In one of the three
vans there was a poor little girl of about nine summers evidently
in the last stage of consumption.&nbsp; Her cheeks were sunken,
shallow, and pale; her fingers were long and thin; her eyes
glassy bright, and black hair hung in tangled masses over her
shoulders.&nbsp; I gave the poor girl a penny as she stood at the
door of the filthy van, for which, with much effort she said,
&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; and sat down on the floor.&nbsp; I
said to the mother, formerly a Smith, but now a G&mdash;,
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get the poor child attended
to?&rdquo;&nbsp; She replied as follows: &ldquo;Well, sir, gipsy
children have much more to put up with now than they formerly
had.&nbsp; They cannot half stand the cold and <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>damp we used
to do.&nbsp; They are always catching cold.&nbsp; I only bought a
bottle of medicine this morning for which I paid half a crown,
and I cannot be expected to do more.&nbsp; She has been staying
some time with her grandmother at Bristol, but we did not like
leaving her there in case anything happened to her.&nbsp; If she
is to die, we gipsies like our children to die in the van or tent
with us, as may be.&nbsp; We like to see the last of them.&nbsp;
We have hard times of it, we poor women and children have, I can
assure you, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; The woman had now begun to do some
washing in earnest, not before it was needed, and while she was
scrubbing away at the rags in a tin pail, she began to tell me
some of her history and that of her grandfather.&nbsp; She said
that her mother had &ldquo;had fifteen children, all born under
the hedge-bottom, nearly all of whom are alive.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
asked her if any of her family could read and write, and she
said, &ldquo;No, excepting the poor little girl you see, and she
can read and write a little, having been to a day school in
Bristol for a few weeks last winter.&nbsp; I wish they could read
and write, sir, it would be a blessed thing if they
could.&rdquo;&nbsp; She now referred to her grandfather.&nbsp; At
this her eyes brightened up.&nbsp; She said, &ldquo;My
grandfather was a soldier in the Queen&rsquo;s
service&rdquo;&mdash;the poor gipsy woman did not understand
history so well as cooking hedgehogs in a patter of
clay&mdash;&ldquo;and fought in the battle when Lord Nelson was
killed.&nbsp; And do you know, sir, after Lord Nelson was killed,
he was put into a cask of rum to be preserved, while he was
brought to England to be buried; and I dare say that you will not
believe me&mdash;my grandfather was one of those who had charge
of the body; but he got drunk on some of the rum in which Lord
Nelson was pickled, and he was always fond of talking about it to
his dying day.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Do you like
rum.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, we poor gipsies could live upon rum
and &lsquo;&rsquo;bacca.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; In the van in which
the poor gipsy child and its mother lived there <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>were a man, a
baby a few weeks old, and four other children, huddling together
night and day in a most demoralizing and degrading
condition.&nbsp; While standing by the side of this tumble-down
van I found that vans and tents, in which people eat, live,
sleep, and die, are put to other shocking, filthy, and sickening
purposes during fairs and races than habitations for human beings
to dwell in.&nbsp; Sanitary officers, moralists, and Christians
must be asleep all over the country.&nbsp; In going by and round
one van I noticed an old woman storming away at some children
with an amount of temper and earnestness that almost frightened
me.&nbsp; Immediately I arrived at the door, and almost before I
could say &ldquo;Jack Robinson,&rdquo; she dropped down into a
position with which miners and gipsies are so familiarly
accustomed, and began to tremble, shed &ldquo;crocodile
tears,&rdquo; and tell a pitiful tale of the sorrows and troubles
of her life, intermixing it with &ldquo;my dear sirs,&rdquo;
&ldquo;good mans,&rdquo; &ldquo;God bless yous.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Every now and then she would look up to heaven, and present a
picture of the most saintly woman upon earth.&nbsp; When I asked
her how old she was, she said she was a long way over seventy,
but could not tell me exactly.&nbsp; She further said that she
had had sixteen children, all born under the hedge-bottom, nearly
all of them gipsies up and down the country, some of whom were
grandmothers and grandfathers at the present time.&nbsp; And then
she would begin another pitiful tale as follows, &ldquo;If you
please, my good sir, will you give me a copper, I do assure you
that I have not tasted anything to eat this day, and I am almost
famished with hunger.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then with trembling
emotion she said, wringing her hands, &ldquo;I shall die before
morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; After my visits to the other vans, and
before going home, I turned unexpectedly to have another peep at
the old gipsy woman, whom I found to be a long way off dying, and
in all probability I shall see her again before she passes over
to the great eternity.</p>

<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Among
the rest, sitting upon a low stool and drinking beer, there was a
big, bony, coarse Frenchman, whom I found out to be a
Communist.&nbsp; He was ostensibly selling calico, lace, and
other trifles.&nbsp; His eyes were fiery, mouth ugly, on account
of its having been put to foul purposes, and his demeanour that
of an excited Fenian maddened by revenge and murder.&nbsp; Round
him were a number of poor ignorant folks who could neither read
nor write, and as they listened to his lies and infamy about the
clergy, ministers, the well-to-do tradesmen, professional
gentlemen, noblemen, and royalty, they opened their eyes and
mouths as if horrified at his words and actions.&nbsp; Among
other things he said the clergy of the Church of England were in
receipt of over &pound;20,000,000 per annum out of the pockets of
the poor.&nbsp; I questioned him as to the source from which it
came, and if he could point out the items in the Budget.&nbsp; At
this he began to get excited and said, &ldquo;It came from direct
and indirect taxes.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Can you give me
one instance or give me particulars in any shape setting forth
the direct taxes in this country collected for the benefit of the
clergy to the amount you say?&rdquo;&nbsp; Instead of replying to
this question he began to stutter and stammer, and appeared
before me with his fists shut, exhibiting all sorts of mountebank
megrims to the terror of some of the listeners and amusement of
others.&nbsp; In the end I calmed him down, and he asked me if I
would buy a parrot of him if I saw him again in two years&rsquo;
time.&nbsp; One of those who stood by said, &ldquo;He has got
parrots enough of his own without buying more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Connected with one of the cocoa-nut establishments, and owned
by a good-hearted gipsy from London, there were the clowns,
fools, hunchbacked old women, and other simpletons to catch the
&ldquo;foolish and the gay.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the back of this
establishment there were all sorts of painted devices, or I
should rather say &ldquo;daubed&rdquo; devices, <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>upon the
sheets, full of satire which the fools with plenty of money could
not read.&nbsp; One was a barber shaving his customers; another
was a donkey, after he had been well fed, turning his heels
towards his silly friends and kicking them in the face and
sending them sprawling upon the ground with their pockets empty;
and many others with the flags of &ldquo;Old England&rdquo;
flying in all directions.&nbsp; I learned some time after that
the owner of this establishment during the two days&rsquo; races
cleared nearly twenty pounds out of fools and cocoa-nuts, giving
thousands of young folks of both sexes a taste for gambling, and
then clearing off to London with smiles and chuckles, and his
poaching dogs at his heels, leaving his customers to say the next
morning, &ldquo;What fools we have been, to be sure!&rdquo;&nbsp;
If I had been at the door of their bedroom I should have bawled
out, &ldquo;No greater fools in existence could possibly
be.&nbsp; When you went upon the race-course you had money if you
had not any sense; this morning you have neither money nor sense,
and now you are neither more nor less than a third of a
shrivelled-up sausage without any seasoning in your nature,
unsuitable for pickling and not worth cooking, fit for nothing
but the dunghill, and food for cats and dogs.&rdquo;&nbsp; I now
took another stroll amongst the gipsies at the other end of the
&ldquo;course,&rdquo; and came up against one who owned the
&ldquo;steam-flying dobby-horses;&rdquo; but before I began to
chat with him one of the gipsy women whispered in my ear,
&ldquo;It is his wife that has made him; she is very good-looking
and one of the best women in the world; no one can tell why it
was that she took up with the man as his second wife.&nbsp; He
would not have been worth twopence had it not been for her.&nbsp;
She is a rare good un, an&rsquo; no mistake.&nbsp; You must not
tell him that I say so.&nbsp; She sees to all the business and he
dotes over her.&nbsp; He is not a bad sort of a
chap.&rdquo;&nbsp; I soon began to chat with the
&ldquo;dobby-horse&rdquo; <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>owner, and he was not long before he
began to tell me of his cleverness and what he had passed
through, as follows: &ldquo;You see, sir, a few years ago I had
to borrow three shillings and sixpence to help me to get away
from this town, now I&rsquo;ve turned the tide and got at the top
of the hill.&nbsp; These &lsquo;shooting galleries,&rsquo;
&lsquo;dobby-horses,&rsquo; &lsquo;flying boxes,&rsquo; vans, and
waggons are my own.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pointing with his finger to a
new van, he said, &ldquo;I made that myself last winter, and have
done all the painting upon the &lsquo;horses&rsquo;
myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; The steam organ, the steam whistle, the
shouting, screaming, and hurrahing, and his face having been in
the wars, made it difficult for me to hear him.&nbsp; He now
spoke out louder and referred to family affairs and some of his
early history.&nbsp; &ldquo;I left Bagworth when I was a lad,
owing to the cruel treatment of a stepmother, and wandered up and
down the country in rags and barefooted, sleeping in barns, and
houses, and piggeries, and other places I could creep into; and
in course of time I fell in with the gipsies and married
one.&nbsp; But she was a wretch; oh! she was a bad un, and I was
glad when she died.&nbsp; I am thankful I have got a better one
now.&nbsp; She is a good un; but I must not say anything about
her, we get on well together, and she keeps me
straight.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Bang bang&rdquo; and &ldquo;crack
crack&rdquo; went the bullets out of the rifle guns close to our
ears, against the metal plates, through a long sheet iron funnel
of about twelve inches diameter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now then,&rdquo;
cried out a little sharp, dark-eyed, nimble woman of about
thirty-five years&mdash;of course upon this point I had no means
of knowing or guessing exactly; I had not examined her
teeth.&nbsp; She might say she was only twenty-eight, a favourite
age with some maids looking out for husbands&mdash;&ldquo;be
quick and rub out the marks upon the plate.&rdquo;&nbsp; And away
the old man trotted at his wife&rsquo;s bidding, as all good
husbands who are not capable of being masters should do.&nbsp; A
&ldquo;slap&rdquo; and a <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>&ldquo;dash&rdquo; with the old
gipsy&rsquo;s brush, and all the &ldquo;pops&rdquo; were for over
obliterated.&nbsp; What a blessed thing it would be for
themselves and future generations if all the sins committed upon
the racecourse that day could have been wiped out as
easily.&nbsp; Why not?</p>
<p>Upon the &ldquo;course&rdquo; there were, at a very rough
calculation, nearly fifty families of gipsies in vans, tents, and
carts, in which vans, tents, &amp;c., there lived over a hundred
and fifty children and one hundred men and women sleeping inside
and huddling together with their eyes open, like rabbits at the
bottom of a flour cask, when no other eye sees them but
God&rsquo;s.&nbsp; While the jockeys were riding to death upon
classical horses with the devil at their heels, to a place where,
as Dr. Grosart says in the <i>Sunday at Home</i>, &ldquo;The
surges of wrath crash on the shores infernal,&rdquo; I mused,
pondered, and then wended my way home for meditation and
reflection, and, as a writer in the <i>Churchman&rsquo;s Penny
Magazine</i> says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We take Thy providence and word<br />
As landmarks on our way.&rdquo;</p>

75</span>Rambles amongst the Gipsies upon the Warwick
Racecourse.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> men&rsquo;s lives, it would
seem, are decreed by Providence to be spent among the
&ldquo;extremes&rdquo; of life and the associations of the
world.&nbsp; Some are walking, talking, humming, and singing to
themselves of the joys of heaven, the pleasures of the world, and
the consoling influences of religion under the bright sunlight of
heaven, as they, with light tread, step along to the goal where
they will be surrounded with endless joy, where the tears of
sorrow, bereavement, and anguish are unknown, and where the
little dancing, prattling joys of earth have been transplanted
into the angelic choir of heaven.&nbsp; There are others to be
seen sitting under the shade upon some ditch bank with their
elbows upon their knees, and their faces buried in their hands,
enveloped in meditation and reflection with reference to the
doings and dealings of Providence towards them on their journey
of life, with an outlook at times that does not seem the least
encouraging and hopeful, ending in mysteries and doubts as to the
future, and the part they will be called upon to play in the
ending drama.&nbsp; There are many who seem to <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>be groping
their way among the dark and heavy clouds which have been filled
by God, in His wisdom, weighted with trouble and circumstances of
earth and self; and while pacing among the clouds and darkness
which have settled upon them almost too heavy to be borne, they
imagine their lot to be the hardest in the world.&nbsp; Such I
thought, has been my lot, as I tripped along, with bag in hand,
over the green carpet, while the warbling little songsters were
singing overhead, and a bright spring sun shining in my face,
bringing life into, on every hand, the enchanting beauty of the
orchards, hedgerows, and meadows, sending forth delicious scents,
and lovely sights of the daisies, primroses, and violets, and a
thousand other heavenly things, on my way to the station on a
lovely spring morning to ramble among the gipsies and others upon
the Warwick racecourse.</p>
<p>In the train, between Welton and Leamington, I met with some
sporting &ldquo;company&rsquo;s servants.&rdquo;&nbsp; One said,
&ldquo;Y. and G. were two of the greatest scamps in the
world.&nbsp; When once the public backed a horse, they were sure
to &lsquo;scratch it.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; They discussed minutely
their &ldquo;bobs,&rdquo; &ldquo;quids,&rdquo; losses, crosses,
and gains.&nbsp; One of the sporting &ldquo;company&rsquo;s
servants&rdquo; was a guard, and he said, &ldquo;I generally gets
the &lsquo;tip&rsquo; from some of the leading betting men I
know, who often travel by my train to the races, and I&rsquo;m
never far wrong.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another &ldquo;company&rsquo;s
servant,&rdquo; related his betting experiences.&nbsp; &ldquo;One
Sunday,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I was at Bootle church, near
Liverpool, and heard the preacher mention in his sermon
&lsquo;Bend Or,&rsquo; and warned his congregation to have
nothing to do with races, and I concluded that there was
something in the horse, or he would not have mentioned his name
in the pulpit.&nbsp; So on Monday morning I determined to put
three &lsquo;bob&rsquo; on &lsquo;Bend Or,&rsquo; and the result
was I had twelve &lsquo;bob&rsquo; and a half, that was a good
day&rsquo;s work for me, which I should <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>not have got
if it had not been for our parson.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said to the
&ldquo;company&rsquo;s servant,&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you really think
that racing is profitable for those engaged in it, taking all
things into consideration?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;to tell you the truth, sir, I do not think it
is.&nbsp; I have often seen dashing, flashing betting characters
compelled to leave their boxes at the station in pawn for a
railway ticket to enable them to get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After leaving the train and the Avenue Station behind me, I
made my way to my friends, Mr. and Mrs. John Lewis, for
&ldquo;labour and refreshment,&rdquo; when, during my midnight
tossings, nocturnal wanderings, and rambles in wonderland, the
following rough and crude germs of thought prevented me getting
the sweet repose which tired nature required:&mdash;</p>
<p>The beautiful snowdrop of heaven, and the first in God&rsquo;s
garden, is a pretty lively child growing up good and pure in the
midst of a wretched family, surrounded by squalor, ignorance, and
sin.</p>
<p>They are enemies, and beware of them, who, in your presence,
laugh when you laugh, sing when you sing, and cry, without tears,
when you cry.</p>
<p>A scientific Christian minister preaching science instead of
the gospel, causing his flock to wander among doubts and hazy
notions, is a scriptural roadman sitting upon a heap of stones
philosophizing with metaphysical skill upon the fineness of the
grain, beauty, and excellent qualities of a piece of granite,
while the roads he is in charge of are growing over with grass,
bewildering to the members of his church as to which is the right
road, and leading them into a bog from which they cannot
extricate themselves, and have to cry out for the helping hand to
save, ere they sink and are lost.</p>
<p>Every glass of beer drunk in a public-house turns a black hair
white.</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>When a
man or woman draws the last sixpence out of his or her pocket in
a public-house, they pull out a cork that lets tears of sorrow
flow.</p>
<p>A publican&rsquo;s cellar is the storehouse of sorrows.</p>
<p>A Christian minister who preaches science instead of
Christianity and the Bible, is going through a dark tunnel with a
dim lamp at the wrong end of his boat.</p>
<p>Beer and spirits make more gaps in a man&rsquo;s character
than righteous women can mend.</p>
<p>The finest pottery has to pass through three crucial stages
during manufacture before it can be said to be perfect.&nbsp;
First is the &ldquo;biscuit oven,&rdquo; whereby the vessels are
made hard and durable.&nbsp; Second is the &ldquo;hardening-on
kiln,&rdquo; or an oven with an even, moderate heat to harden or
burn on the surface the various designs and colours which have
been placed there by artistic hands.&nbsp; And the third is the
&ldquo;glost oven,&rdquo; which brings out the transparent gloss
and finish, and gives beauty to the gold, oxide, cobalt, nickel,
manganese, ochre, stone, flint, bone, iron, and clay,
&amp;c.&nbsp; So in like manner it is with the highest type of a
Christian character.&nbsp; First, there is the family circle with
its moulding and parental influence: this may be called the
&ldquo;biscuit oven,&rdquo; fixing on the preparation for the
fights and hardships of life.&nbsp; Second, there is the school
and educational progress, which may be compared to the
&ldquo;hardening-on kiln.&rdquo;&nbsp; And third, there is the
work of the Holy Spirit: this may be compared to the &ldquo;glost
oven,&rdquo; which gives the gloss, touch, and transparency to
the vessel.&nbsp; Each of these stages will include the
progressive steps of manufacture leading up to them.</p>
<p>Spectacles are of no use to a man in the dark.&nbsp; So in
like manner scientific problems cannot help a man to see his way
if he is in spiritual darkness.</p>
<p>Acrobatic Christians are those whose spiritual backbone <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>and moral
uprightness have been damaged by contortions, megrims, twirlings,
and twisting their Christian character to suit circumstances.</p>
<p>So long as a man keeps upright the law of gravitation has but
little power over him; immediately he begins to stoop its
influence is soon manifest.&nbsp; So in like manner it is with an
upright Christian, and so long as he keeps his perpendicular
position by walking erect in God&rsquo;s love and favour he is
all right, and the influence of hell trebled cannot bend or pull
him down; immediately he stoops to listen to the voice of the
charmer, and gives way to the gravitation of
hell&mdash;sin&mdash;down he goes, and nothing but a miracle will
bring him upright again.</p>
<p>A hollow, hypocritical, twirl-about Christian, with no
principle to guide him, is as an empty, shallow vessel pushed out
to sea without either compass, rudder, or sails.</p>
<p>A man who, Christ-like, stoops to pick up a fallen brother, or
who guides and places a youth upon a successful path, leading to
immortality, is a man among men whom God delights to honour, as
Jupiter was among the heathen gods, and he will be doubly
crowned.&nbsp; His crown upon earth will be studded with lasting
pleasure, shining brighter than diamonds; but his crown in heaven
will be studded and illumined with the everlasting smiles of
those he has saved, surpassing in grandeur all the precious
stones in creation.</p>
<p>When a professing Christian visits the tap-room and places of
light amusement with the hope of finding safe anchorage from the
storms of life, it may be taken as an indication that he is at
sea without a rudder, and the temporary one manufactured in a
gin-palace out of frothy conversation will not bring him safe to
land.</p>
<p>To hold up good works without faith and prayer as a shelter
from an angry God for wrong-doing, is like holding <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>a riddle over
your head as a protection from a thunderstorm.</p>
<p>A man indulging in a lifetime of sin and iniquity, and then
praying to God and giving alms in the last hours of his existence
in the hope of securing eternal life and endless joy, is like a
fowl with a broken neck and wings struggling to pick up golden
grain to give it life and strength to fly to roost.</p>
<p>Love and spite dwelling in the heart can no more make a
perfect Christian than poisoned vinegar and cream can make pure
honey.</p>
<p>Every huntsman who jumps a fence makes it easier for those who
choose to follow; and so it is with wrongdoers who jump the
bounds of sin and folly.&nbsp; They are teaching those who follow
to shun the plain, open path, and to take to the walls, fences,
and ditches, which end in a broken neck, amidst the applause of
fools.</p>
<p>Hotbeds of envy and hatred, heated with burning passion, have
been productive of more evil results, direful consequences,
bloodshed, cruel deaths, and foul murders than all the poison
extracted from fungi, hemlock, foxgloves, and deadly nightshade
have done since the world began, or could do, even if envy and
hatred were to die to-day and poisons worked death to the end of
time.</p>
<p>The morals and good deeds of a wicked, sensual, selfish man
are the artificial flowers of hell.</p>
<p>Some professing Christians have only sufficient Christianity
to make a pocket mirror, which the possessor uses in company as a
schoolboy would to make &ldquo;Jack-a-dandies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crowns of credit or renown lightly won sit lightly upon the
head, and are easily puffed off by the first breath of public
opinion.</p>
<p>A man who trusts to his own self-righteousness to get him to
heaven is wheeling a heavily and unevenly laden <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>wheelbarrow
up a narrow, slippery plank over a deep ravine, with a wheel in
the front of his wheelbarrow that is twisted, loose, and
awry.</p>
<p>The devil plays most with those he means to bite the
hardest.</p>
<p>Singing heavenly songs in earthly sorrows brings joy tinged
with the golden light of heaven on the mourner.</p>
<p>To get the cold, poisonous water of selfishness from our
hearts God has often to furrow and drain our nature and
affections by afflictions and cross purposes.</p>
<p>Too-much conceited young Christians with little piety, like
young &ldquo;quickset&rdquo; hedges, become of more use to the
Christian Church and the world after they have been cut down by
persecution and bent by troubles and afflictions.</p>
<p>Sin in the first instance is as playful as a kitten and as
harmless as a lamb; but in the end it will bite more than a tiger
and sting more than a nest of wasps.</p>
<p>A Christian professor outside the range of miracles and under
the influence of the devil is he who is trying to swim to heaven
with a barrel of beer upon his back.</p>
<p>As fogs are bad conductors of light, sight, and sound, so in
like manner is a Christian living in foggy doubts a bad conductor
of the light, sight, and sounds of heaven.</p>
<p>Cold, slippery Christians who have no good object before them,
and without a noble principle to guide them, are like round balls
of ice on a large dish; and to set such Christians to work is a
worse task than serving the balls out with a knitting needle.</p>
<p>Crotchety, doubting, scientific Christians are manufacturers
of more deadly poisons than that produced from pickled old rusty
nails.</p>
<p>The loudest and most quickening sounds to be heard upon earth
are from a beautiful sweet child as it lies in the stillness of
the loving arms of death.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Breakfast being over, with my &ldquo;Gladstone bag&rdquo; I <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>begun my
tramp-trot to the &ldquo;course,&rdquo; and while walking
leisurely under the tall trees in one of the avenues at
Leamington, on my way to the racecourse, a circumstance
occurred&mdash;which my friend the gipsies say &ldquo;forbodes
good luck and a fortune, and that I shall rise in the world and
have many friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gipsies say and do queer
things.&nbsp; To see, say they, the tail of the first spring lamb
instead of its face forebodes &ldquo;bad luck&rdquo; to the
beholder through the year.&nbsp; In the tramcar there was a
little dog with a silver collar round its neck, evidently without
an owner.&nbsp; The pretty little white English terrier whined
about in quest of its master or mistress, but neither was to be
found.&nbsp; In the tramcar there was a police inspector on his
way to do double duty at the racecourse.&nbsp; This kind-hearted
man tried hard by coaxing, sop, and caresses to be a friend to
the dog; but no, and for the life of him the dog could not be
brought round to look upon the inspector as a friend.&nbsp;
Immediately the tramcar stopped, the little dog bounded off in
search of its owner, but none was to be found, and the last I saw
of the inspector and the lost dog was up one of the streets at
Warwick, with the dog ahead and its tail between its legs, and
the inspector scampering after it as fast as he could run,
calling out, &ldquo;Stop it,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stop it,&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lost;&rdquo; and away they both went out of
sight, and neither the one nor the other have I seen since.</p>
<p>I once worked for a master in the slave yards of Brickdom in
Staffordshire, who owned a bulldog.&nbsp; This dog took it into
his head one day to leave its cruel master, and seek fresh
lodgings of a better kind.&nbsp; Spying its opportunity, off it
started out of the brickyard as if it was shot out of a gun; and
the master for whom I slaved could not whistle, and knowing that
I could whistle as well as I could cry and sing, bawled out to
me, &ldquo;Whistle <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>him, whistle him, or I&rsquo;ll black your eye!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve lost a dog worth five shillings; whistle
him!&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course, under the circumstances, trembling
with fear and fright, I could not &ldquo;whistle&rdquo; very
loud.&nbsp; The consequence was, the dog was lost, and I got a
&ldquo;good kick and a punch.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the inspector could
have whistled for the lost dog in the tones of its mistress, it
would have saved his legs and brought the dog back to its
comfortable home.</p>
<p>I was no sooner upon the racecourse, paddling through the
quagmire, than I was brought face to face with some of the
gipsies&mdash;the Hollands and the Claytons.&nbsp; I had not long
been talking to them before one of the old Hollands came up to me
and said, &ldquo;I know who you are, Mr. Smith of Coalville;
lend&rsquo;s your hand, and let&rsquo;s have a good shake.&nbsp;
I would not mind giving five shillings for your
likeness.&rdquo;&nbsp; I told him he need not be at the expense
of giving five shillings for a flattering photograph; he could
have a good stare at the original, with all its faults,
blemishes, and scars, for nothing.&nbsp; In my hands were a lot
of picture cards for the gipsy children, given to me by the
Religious Tract Society, upon which were a lot of texts of
Scripture, in pretty patterns.&nbsp; Some of them read as
follows: &ldquo;My son, forget not my law;&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou art
my trust from my youth;&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou God seest me;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thy word is a lamp unto my feet;&rdquo; &ldquo;My son,
give me thine heart;&rdquo; &ldquo;Wisdom is more precious than
rubies;&rdquo; &ldquo;Enter not into the path of the
wicked;&rdquo; &ldquo;Even a child is known by his doings;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Feed my lambs;&rdquo; &ldquo;Hear instruction, and be
wise;&rdquo; &ldquo;Show piety at home;&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord
bless and keep thee;&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord preserveth all them
that love Him;&rdquo; &ldquo;I will guide thee with mine
eye;&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord shall preserve thee from all
evil;&rdquo; and many more.&nbsp; Immediately I had begun to
distribute them among the children clustered round me, Alfred
Clayton came up to me, as close as he could get, and <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>he said, as I
read out some of the texts to the children &ldquo;I do like them;
I could die by them; I&rsquo;d sooner have some of them than a
meal&rsquo;s meat at any time.&nbsp; Do give me some, Mr. Smith,
and I&rsquo;ll get somebody to read them to me, and will take
great care of them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have them framed and hung
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Hollands now asked me to go into their van,
which invitation I gladly accepted.&nbsp; I was no sooner seated
than Mrs. Holland, a big strong woman with pipe in her mouth,
began to tell me how many children they had had, and that she had
&ldquo;been a nurse for the Lord,&rdquo; for she had &ldquo;had
twelve children, nine of whom had died before they were three
years old, and three are living, two of whom you
see.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this point she flew off at a tangent in
language not suited for this book.&nbsp; Any one hearing her
would think that she was a somewhat queer and strange kind of
&ldquo;nurse for the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Holland the elder
told me of one poor gipsy woman, who, through her unfaithfulness
and bad conduct, had come to an untimely end, so much so that it
was with much difficulty and risk her rotten remains were placed
in a coffin.&nbsp; Sad to say, her sins were not buried with
her.&nbsp; Her family carry the marks upon them.&nbsp; After
chatting about all sorts of things and old times, with the
Leicestershire gipsies from Barlestone and Barwell, I turned in
with some gipsy Smiths from Gloucestershire, whose van and tents
were on the other side of the &ldquo;grand stand.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
found that in three of the vans there were twenty-one children of
various sizes and ages, and nine men and women sleeping and
huddling together in wretchedness.&nbsp; One of the gipsy women
told me that she had had &ldquo;nineteen children all born
alive.&rdquo;&nbsp; As they sat round the fire upon the grass, I
began to give them some cards, and while I was doing so, one of
the men, Reservoir Smith, broke out in language not very
elevating, and said among other things, &ldquo;What use are
picture <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>cards to either the children or us; there is not one in
the whole bunch that can tell a letter; and as for saying
prayers, they do not know what it is and where to begin.&nbsp; We
cannot pray ourselves, much less teach our children.&nbsp; Who
are we to pray to?&nbsp; Parsons pray, and not we poor
folks.&rdquo;&nbsp; A gipsy woman must needs have her say in the
matter, and said as follows, &ldquo;Do not mind what he says
master, if you will give me some of the cards we will have them
framed; they will do to look at if we cannot read
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this they clustered round me&mdash;men,
women and children; and I distributed cards and pence to the
little ones as far as my stock would allow, with which all were
delighted.</p>
<p>In the midst of this large group of idle men and women,
ragged, dirty, unkempt, and ignorant children with matted hair,
there were two of the Smith damsels&mdash;say, of about eighteen
or twenty years&mdash;dressed in all the gay and lively colours
imaginable, whose business was not to attend to the cocoa-nut
&ldquo;set outs,&rdquo; but to wheedle their way with gipsy
fascination amongst the crowd of race-goers, to gain
&ldquo;coppers&rdquo; in all sorts of questionable ways of those
&ldquo;greenhorns&rdquo; who choose to listen to their
&ldquo;witching&rdquo; tales of gipsydom.&nbsp; Their
&ldquo;lurchers&rdquo; and &ldquo;snap&rdquo; dogs came and smelt
at my pantaloons, and skulked away with their tails between their
legs.</p>
<p>Upon the course there were over thirty adult gipsies, and
nearly forty children living in tents and vans, and connected in
one way or other with the gipsy Smiths, Greens, Hollands,
Stanleys, and Claytons, not one of whom&mdash;excepting one
Stanley&mdash;could read and write a simple sentence out of any
book, and attended neither a place of worship nor any Sunday or
day school.&nbsp; When I explained to them the plan I proposed
for registering their vans, and bringing the children within
reach of the schoolmaster, they one and all agreed to it without
any <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>hesitation, and said as follows, that &ldquo;it would be
the best thing in the world, and unitedly expressed more than
once, &lsquo;Thank you, sir,&rsquo; &lsquo;Thank you,
sir.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rain was now coming down, and the races were about to
commence; therefore my gipsy congregation had begun to find its
way to the various cocoa-nut establishments to begin business in
earnest.&nbsp; With this exodus going on around me, and in the
midst of oaths, swearing, betting, banging, cheating, lying,
shouting, and thrashing, I turned quickly into Alfred
Clayton&rsquo;s van to have a friendly chat with him with
&ldquo;closed doors.&rdquo;&nbsp; The conversation I had with him
earlier in the afternoon led me to think that some kind of
influence had been at work with him that one does not see in a
thousand times among gipsies.&nbsp; Evidently a softening process
had taken hold of him which I wanted to hear more about.&nbsp;
With his wife and another gipsy friend in charge of his cocoa-nut
business, we closed the door of the van, and he began his tale in
answer to my questions.&nbsp; I asked him whether they had always
been gipsies.&nbsp; To which he answered as follows: &ldquo;My
grandfather was a &lsquo;stockiner&rsquo; at Barlestone, and
lived in a cottage there; but in course of time he began to do a
little hawking, first out of a basket round the villages, and
then in a cart round the country.&nbsp; He then took to a van;
and the same thing may be said of the Claytons.&nbsp; Originally
they were &lsquo;stockiners&rsquo; at Barwell, a village close to
Barlestone, and began to travel as my grandfather and father had
done.&nbsp; Thus you will see that the two families of gipsies,
Claytons and Hollands, are mixed up pretty much.&nbsp; My father
is, as you know, a Holland, and my mother a Clayton, whose name I
take.&nbsp; At the present time, out of the original family of
Hollands at Barlestone, and the original family of Claytons at
Barwell, there are seven families of Hollands travelling the
country at the present time, and fifteen families of Claytons
travelling in <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>various parts of Staffordshire and other
places.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the original two families it will be
seen that there are over a hundred and fifty men, women, and
children who have taken to gipsying within the last fifty years,
not half a dozen of whom can read and write, with all the
attendant consequences of this kind of a vagabond rambling life;
which the more we look into, it is plain that Christianity and
civilization, as we have put them forth to reclaim those of our
own brothers and sisters near home, have proved a failure, not on
account of the blessed influences of themselves being not
powerful enough, but in the lack of the application of them to
the gipsies by those who profess to have received those
world-moving principles in their hearts.&nbsp; In the midst of
this dark mass of human beings moving to and fro upon our lovely
England, one little cheering ray is to be seen.&nbsp; Alfred
Clayton tells us this.&nbsp; When he was staying at Leicester
with his van some three years since, he stole like a thief in the
night into the &ldquo;Salvation Warehouse&rdquo; at the bottom of
Belgrave Gate, and while he was there an influence penetrated
through the hardened coats of ignorance and crime, and the
ramification of sin in all its worst shape to the depth of his
heart, and awakened a chord of sympathy in his nature which has
not died out, or wholly left him to this day.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jesus
the name high over all&rdquo; caused him to open his ears in a
manner they had never been opened before, and wonder what it all
meant.&nbsp; This visit to the &ldquo;Salvation warehouse&rdquo;
was not lost upon him, or without its effects upon his
conduct.&nbsp; One cold wintry day, some two years ago, he was
staying with his wife and family in this van on the roadside
between Atherstone and Hinckley, when a youth, apparently about
eighteen years old, came limping along the road, dressed in what
had once been a fashionable suit of clothes, but now was little
better than rags.&nbsp; His face was thin and pale, and his
fingers long, and his neck bare.&nbsp; Upon his feet were two odd
<a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>old
worn-out shoes, and without stockings upon his legs; and as the
forlorn youth neared the van and its occupants at dusk, he said,
&ldquo;Will you please give me a bit of bread, for I feel very
hungry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Clayton said, without much inquiry and
hesitation, &ldquo;Come into the van and warm yourself,&rdquo;
and while the youth was doing so, they got ready a crust of bread
and cheese and some tea, which were devoured ravenously.&nbsp;
Clayton learned that the stranger was related to one of the
leading manufacturers named at Leicester, and well known as being
rich; but unfortunately for the poor youth, his father died, and
his stepmother had sold everything and cleared away to America,
leaving this well-educated lad without any money, or means of
earning money, to grapple with the world and its difficulties for
a livelihood as best he could.&nbsp; Clayton, in the kindness of
his heart, took the youth into the van, and he travelled up and
down the country with them as one of their own during the space
of two years, when owing to &ldquo;his being a gentleman,&rdquo;
and a &ldquo;capital scollard,&rdquo; he was helpful to the gipsy
family in more ways than one.&nbsp; After the two years&rsquo;
gipsying spent by the youth with his kind friends the Claytons in
rambling about the country, some kind friends at Atherstone took
pity on him, and he is there to-day, gradually working his
position back into civilized society, and a respectable member of
the community, notwithstanding the treatment he has received at
the hands of his cruel stepmother.&nbsp; After the meeting at the
&ldquo;Salvation Warehouse&rdquo; Clayton had been seen and heard
more than once, checking swearing and other sins so common to
gipsies; but had never finally decided to leave gipsying and
begin a better life until last Christmas.&nbsp; The steps which
led up to his &ldquo;great resolve,&rdquo; he related to me as
follows: &ldquo;Mr. Smith, you must know that I have been about
as bad a man as could be found anywhere.&nbsp; I felt at times,
through drink and other things, that I would <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>as soon
murder somebody as I would eat my supper; in fact, I didn&rsquo;t
care what I did; and things went on in this way till my little
girl, about three years old, and who I loved to the bottom of my
heart, was taken ill and died.&nbsp; She had such bright eyes, a
lovely face, and curls upon her head.&nbsp; She was my darling
pet, and always met me with a smile; but she died and lies buried
in Polesworth churchyard.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this Clayton burst into
crying and sobbing like a child.&nbsp; &ldquo;I vowed,&rdquo;
said Clayton, &ldquo;on the day, at the side of the grave, she,
my poor darling, was buried, that I would not touch drink for a
month, and do you know, Mr. Smith of Coalville, when the month
was gone, I did not feel to crave for drink any more, and I have
not had any up till now.&rdquo;&nbsp; He now dried his eyes, and
his face brightened up with a smile, and I said to him in the
van, &ldquo;Let us kneel down and thank God for helping you to
make this resolution, and for grace to help you to keep
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the midst of the hum, shouting, and swearing
of the races, we shut the door of the van; and after we had got
off our knees, he knelt down again and again, and began to pray,
with tears in his eyes, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Lord Jesus, Thou knowest that I have been a bad
sinner.&nbsp; O God, thou knowest I have been very wicked in many
ways, and done many things I should not have done; but Thou hast
told me to come to Thee and Thou wilt forgive me.&nbsp; Do my God
forgive me for all the wrong I have done, and help me to be a
better man, and never touch drink again any more, for Thou
knowest it has been my ruin.&nbsp; Help me to live a good life,
so that I may meet my little darling in heaven, who lies in
Polesworth churchyard.&nbsp; Do, O Lord, bless my wife and my
other little children, and make them all good.&nbsp; Oh do, my
heavenly Father help my mother to give over swearing and bad
things.&nbsp; Thou canst do it.&nbsp; Do Thou bless my father,
and my brothers, and all my relations, and Mr. Smith <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>in his work,
and for being so good to us, so that we may all meet in heaven,
for Jesus Christ&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name,
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in
heaven.&nbsp; Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us
our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against
us.&nbsp; And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from
evil.&nbsp; For Thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory,
for ever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Clayton had dried his eyes we got up, to behold, over
the top of the bottom half of his van door, the riders, dressed
in red, scarlet, yellow, green, blue, crimson, and orange, with a
deep <i>black shade</i> to be seen <i>underneath</i>, galloping
to hell with hordes of gamblers at their heels as fast as their
poor, cruelly treated steeds could carry them, all leaving
footprints behind them for young beginners to follow.&nbsp; I
said to Clayton, &ldquo;Are you not tired of this kind of
life?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he said he was.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is no good
for anybody,&rdquo; said Clayton, &ldquo;and I am going to leave
it.&nbsp; This is my last day with the
&lsquo;cocoa-nuts.&rsquo;&nbsp; I shall start in the
morning&mdash;Saturday&mdash;for Coventry and Atherstone, where I
mean to settle down and bring my children up like other
folks.&nbsp; I have taken a house and am going to furnish it, and
a gentleman is going to give me a chance of learning a trade, for
which I thank God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the shouts of the hell-bound multitude were dying away, and
the gains and losses reckoned up, Clayton&rsquo;s three little
gipsy children, with their lovely features, curls, and bright
blue eyes, came toddling up the steps to the van door, calling
out, &ldquo;Dad, let us in; dad, let us in.&rdquo;&nbsp; The door
was opened, and the little dears comfortably seated by our
side.&nbsp; I gave them a few pictures, some coppers, stroked
their hair, and &ldquo;chucked their chin,&rdquo; and bade them
good-bye in the midst of a shower of rain, <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>to meet again
some day with the bright sun shining overhead and a clear sky
without a cloud to be seen anywhere.&nbsp; For the present I must
say with John Harris in his <i>Wayside Pictures</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Where Thou leadest it is best;<br />
Cheer me with the thought of rest,<br />
Till I gain the upper shore,<br />
And my <i>tent</i> is struck no more.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>Rambles among the Gipsies at Boughton Green Fair.</h2>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">HAD</span> heard much and often about
the Boughton Green Fair, and the vast number of gipsies,
semi-gipsies, and other tramps, scamps, vagabonds, hawkers,
farmers, tradesmen, the fast and loose, riff-raff and
respectable, gathered together from all quarters once a year upon
this ancient Green for a &ldquo;fairing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tradesmen
and farmers exhibited their wares, live stock, and implements of
husbandry; and others set forth their articles of torture, things
of fashion, painted faces, &ldquo;tomfoolery,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;bosh,&rdquo; to those who like to tramp thither in
sunshine and storm with plenty of money in their pockets for
revel and debauch.</p>
<p>Bidding the sparrows, linnets, swallows, and wagtails,
fluttering and darting round our dwelling, good-bye as they were
hopping, chirping, twittering, and gathering a variety of
materials upon which to build their nests; and with my little
folks at the door, I wended my way to the station.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then he kissed his olive branches,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bade his wife good-bye,<br />
And said, . . .<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Heaven preserve you
all!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Wayside Pictures</i> (<span
class="smcap">Harris</span>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>The sun
was shining warmly, the roads dusty, and a few red faces covered
with perspiration were to be seen panting along.&nbsp; Many of
the men were dressed in black cloth, a little faded, of the
&ldquo;cut&rdquo; and fashion out of date many years ago.&nbsp;
Some had their coats hung upon their arm, with white shirt
sleeves and heavy boots everywhere visible.&nbsp; Most fairly
well-to-do farm labourers have for Sundays and mourning days a
black suit, which lasts them for many years.&nbsp; In some
instances the father&rsquo;s black clothes become family
&ldquo;heirlooms&rdquo;&mdash;at any rate, for a time&mdash;and
then, when the father dies, they are turned into garments for the
little children.&nbsp; Of course the father&rsquo;s &ldquo;black
silk furred hat&rdquo; cannot be made less, and to pad it to make
it fit little Johnny&rsquo;s head is an awkward process.&nbsp; I
have seen many <i>little boys</i> with big hats upon their heads
in my time.&nbsp; I suppose they have imagined that people would
infer that they had big heads under the hats with plenty of brain
power.&nbsp; This is a mistake.&nbsp; Big hats, with little brain
and less common sense, and No. 10 rather high, often go
together.&nbsp; Upon the road would be &ldquo;Our Sal&rdquo; with
her &ldquo;chap,&rdquo; and his brother Jim, yawning, shouting,
and gaping along, and, as my friends the boatmen would say,
&ldquo;a little beerish.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of the country
labouring girls would have their shawls upon their arms, and they
would be stalking along in their strong boots at the rate of four
miles an hour, frolicking and screaming as Bill Sands, Jack
Jiggers, Joe Straw, Matt Twist, and Ben Feeder jostled against
them.&nbsp; They seemed to delight in showing the tops of their
boots, with crumpled and overhanging stockings.&nbsp; There were
other occupants of the road trudging limpingly after the cows,
sheep, horses, donkeys, and mules, called &ldquo;tramps&rdquo;
and &ldquo;drovers,&rdquo; who seemed to be, and really are, the
&ldquo;cast-offs&rdquo; of society.&nbsp; These poor mortals
were, as a rule, either as thin as herrings or as bloated as <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>pigs, with
faces red with beer-barrel paint; and they wore gentlemen&rsquo;s
&ldquo;cast-off&rdquo; clothing in the last stages of
consumption, with rags flying in the wind.&nbsp; Their once
high-heeled boots were nearly upside down, while dirty toes,
patches, and rag-stuffing were everywhere visible.</p>
<p>In the train there was the usual jostle, bustle, and crush,
and gossip.&nbsp; At Northampton station there was no little
commotion, owing to the station-master having closed the
station-yard against all cabs except those who ply regularly
between the station and the town.</p>
<p>One cabman came to me and said that he would take me to the
Green for a less fare than he charged others if I would get into
his cab the first.&nbsp; I asked him his reason.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you get in first others
will follow, and I shall soon have a load.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could
not see the force of his argument, and found my way to another
cab.&nbsp; I had no sooner seated myself than the cabman took
off, or hid, his number.&nbsp; I asked him why he did that.&nbsp;
His answer was, &ldquo;So that if I drive fast the Bobbies
shan&rsquo;t catch the sight of my number.&nbsp; If they get my
number and I am caught driving fast there will be either thirty
&lsquo;bob&rsquo; for me to pay, or I shall have to go to
&lsquo;quad&rsquo; for a fortnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the poor horses attached to the vehicles&mdash;cabs,
waggonettes, carriers carts, carriages&mdash;were heavily laden
with human beings, till they could scarcely crawl.&nbsp; Uphill,
down dale, slashing, dashing, banging, whipping, kicking, and
shouting seemed to be the order of the day; and on this vast mass
of human and animal life poured&mdash;and myself among the
crowd&mdash;till I found we were fairly among the gipsies upon
the Green.</p>
<p>Having partaken of a starvation lunch in one of the booths,
consisting of &ldquo;reecy&rdquo; fat ham, with a greasy knife
and fork, dried bread and lettuce, served upon plates not over
clean, and studded and painted with patches of mustard <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>left by a
former customer, and with warm ginger-beer as tame as skim milk
to take the place of champagne, I began to take stock of the
Green, which natural formation, together with those made
apparently hundreds of years ago, seemed to excite my first
attention.</p>
<p>The large circular holes, of about thirty feet diameter and
one foot below the level of the surrounding ground, reminded me
very much of ancient gipsy encampments.&nbsp; Boughton Green has
been a favourite annual camping ground for generations, and may
to-day be considered as the fluctuating capital of gipsydom in
the Midlands, where the gipsies from all the Midland and many
other counties do annually congregate to fight, quarrel, brawl,
pray, sing, rob, steal, cheat, and, in past times, murder.</p>
<p>According to Wetton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Guide to
Northamptonshire,&rdquo; published some fifty-six years ago, it
seems probable that the fair was formerly set out in canvas
streets, after the manner of a maze, shepherd&rsquo;s-race, or
labyrinth; and as Boughton Green was close to a Roman station,
this seems probable.&nbsp; This was the custom of the Roman fairs
held close to their stations.&nbsp; This much seems to be
inferred from Baker&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of
Northamptonshire,&rdquo; where he says, &ldquo;The stretching
canvas forms the gaudy streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the <i>Northampton Mercury</i>, June 5, 1721, the following
advertisement appears: &ldquo;The Right Hon. the Earl of
Strafford has been pleased to give a bat, value one guinea, to be
played for on Monday at cudgels, and another of the same price;
and also 6 pairs of buckskin gloves at 5s. a pair, to be wrestled
for on Tuesday; and a silver cup of the value of 5 guineas price
to be run for on Wednesday by maiden galloways not exceeding 14
hands high, during the time of Boughton Fair.&nbsp; The ladies of
the better rank to meet to raffle, see the shows, and then to
adjourn to a ball at the Red Lion Inn, Northampton, in the
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>In
Baker&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Northamptonshire&rdquo; the
following poem appears relative to the fair&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From every part stretched o&rsquo;er the
sultry way,<br />
The labouring team the various stores convey.<br />
Vessels of wood and brass, all bright and new,<br />
In merry mixture rise upon the view.<br />
See! pots capacious lesser pots entomb,<br />
And hogsheads barrels gorge for want of room;<br />
From their broad base part in each other hid<br />
The lessening tubs shoot up like a pyramid.<br />
Pitchforks and axes and the deepening spade<br />
Beneath the pressing load are harmless laid;<br />
Whilst out behind, where pliant poles prevail,<br />
The merry waggon seems to wag her tail.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looked at from rising ground, far in the distance and with a
keen sense for the picturesque and romantic, the moral and
physical aspects of nature, and love of liberty, which gipsy life
presents to those few unacquainted with its dark, degrading
side&mdash;thank God, only a few&mdash;are food for admiration
and wonder; to others the objects of pity and suggestive
reflection.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that Cowper, the immortal
poet, who lived at Olney, a few miles from Boughton Green and
Higham Ferrers, as he was wont to take his daily walks, would
often cross the path of the Northamptonshire gipsies.&nbsp;
Sometimes there would accompany him his two lady friends who were
jealous of each other&rsquo;s influence&mdash;Lady Austin and
Mrs. Unwin.&nbsp; Occasionally Lady Hesketh and some of the
Throckmortons would be the cheerful companions in his despondency
and gloom, and at other times he would sally forth single-handed
in quest of food for his hares and leverets, in silent meditation
upon the grand and beautiful surroundings.&nbsp; It is more than
probable that while he saw from the beautiful elevation, a few
miles outside Olney and Weston, the grey smoke rising from the
gipsy encampment in the distance silently and quietly whirling,
twirling, and ascending among the trees, to be lost among <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>the daisies
and hedgerows, the muses danced before him and brought forth the
truthful, characteristic poem relating to gipsies&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I see a column of slow rising smoke<br />
O&rsquo;ertop the lofty wood that skirts the wild.<br />
A vagabond and useless tribe there eat<br />
Their miserable meal.&nbsp; A kettle<br />
Slung between two poles, upon a stick transverse<br />
Receives the morsel; flesh <i>obscene</i> hog<br />
Or vermin; or at best of cock purloined<br />
From his accustomed perch.&nbsp; Hard-faring race<br />
They pick their fuel out of every hedge<br />
Which, kindled with dry leaves and wood, just saves<br />
The spark of life.&nbsp; The sportive wind blows wide<br />
Their fluttering rags, and shows a tawny skin<br />
The vellum of the pedigree they claim.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The publication of this poem, and the fact that large numbers
of gipsy tramps were flitting about the country, with their
wretched equipages, may have been the means of stirring the kind
hearts of Smith, Crabb, Hoyland, William Allen, of Higham
Ferrers, solicitor, and steward to Earl Fitzwilliam, and many
others, some eighty or one hundred years ago, to try to reclaim
the gipsies from their debasing habits and customs.</p>
<p>It has generally been supposed that the term
&ldquo;green,&rdquo; given to the land upon which the annual fair
is held, comes to us at this date on account of its
greensward.&nbsp; This is an error.&nbsp; According to
Baker&rsquo;s and other histories of Northamptonshire, Boughton
Green derives its name and title as follows.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the
time of Edward I., William de Nutricilla, abbot of St.
Wandegisile, conveyed the lands to John de Boketon or Boughton,
from whom they descended to Sir Thomas de Boketon his grandson,
and who was succeeded by Sir Henry Green his son and heir, who
was Lord Chief Justice of England.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus we see the
probability of it being called at this ancient date, on <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>account of
the close relationship existing between the Boketon or Boughton
and Green, Boughton and Green&rsquo;s wake or fair.&nbsp; In
course of time the &ldquo;and&rdquo; has been dropped, and we
have now &ldquo;Boughton Green fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Henry Green obtained a grant or charter, dated 28th
February, 1351 (25 of Edward III.), for an annual fair to be held
on the manor for the space of three days, beginning with the
vigil of the nativity of St. John the Baptist (June 23rd), and
ending the day after it.&rdquo;&nbsp; This being so, the adding
of &ldquo;green&rdquo; to the fair can be easily accounted
for.&nbsp; The site upon which the fair is held is seventeen
acres.</p>
<p>Outside, and at the east end of the fair grounds, stands the
remains of what was once, no doubt, a fine old Gothic church,
dedicated then, as the new church in the village is now, to St.
John the Baptist.&nbsp; The tower and spire of the old church
fell about a century ago upon a gipsy Smith and his wife, whose
sleeping quarters&mdash;instead of the gipsy tent&mdash;had been
for some time beneath its crumbling ruins.&nbsp; The old
villagers will tell you, with pride and pleasure upon their
faces, that Boughton old church was, before Cromwell destroyed
it, one of the seven oldest churches in England.&nbsp; Of course,
this is a subject upon which I do not feel to be &ldquo;master of
the situation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was the odium attached to
gipsies a century ago, that it was not thought worthwhile to dig
them out from beneath the mass of ruins that had fallen upon
them; and from the time when the tower and spire fell, to the
time when the crumbling refuse was cleared away a few years
since, the bones of poor gipsy Smith and his wife had crumbled
into dust and been scattered to the winds.&nbsp; It touches a
tender and sympathetic chord, and draws forth a scalding tear
down one&rsquo;s face when one ponders over the many evenings the
old gipsy couple had enjoyed their frugal meal&mdash;maybe of
hedgehogs and snails, or the piece of <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>a decaying pig&mdash;beneath the
belfry, when the bells were pealing forth, soft and low, as the
shades of evening were gathering round them, and they were
preparing to rest their aimless and useless bones upon the straw
in their dark, at times musical, and at other times dismal, abode
among the dead.&nbsp; The churchyard and burial ground round the
old church is well fenced in, and kept in beautiful order.&nbsp;
Several gipsies are buried in the churchyard; but there is no
stone to mark the exact spot.&nbsp; They are pretty close to each
other, so I am told, at the east end of the church.</p>
<p>Close to the churchyard there is a spring of excellent water,
called St. John&rsquo;s Spring.&nbsp; So highly did our
forefathers value it, that it was preserved specially as a
rippling little fountain for supplying water for the holy rite of
baptism.&nbsp; When I saw it, gipsies, tramps, show people,
vagabonds, and all kinds of dirty and clean travellers, with
their wretched companions, steeds, and poor bony beasts of
burden, were quenching their thirst at this living stream,
forcing its way out of the hillside.&nbsp; It seemed, as I stood
by, looking at the pails put under its mouth for a filling, to
force its way faster, and with greater gusto, delight, and
pleasure into the dirty pails, owned by dirty hands and dirtier
faces, whose filthy bodies were covered with stinking rags, than
into clean pails carried by white hands and lovely smiling faces
peering over them.&nbsp; One little dirty urchin put his mouth
under it for &ldquo;a drink.&rdquo;&nbsp; No sooner was this
done, than the holy spring covered his unholy dirty face with
more clear water than he wanted, some of which found its way down
his bosom and into his breeches; at this he &ldquo;sobbed,&rdquo;
and sobbed right out that I could not help laughing.&nbsp; He
turned up his piebald watery face as if in anger at my laughing
at him.&nbsp; I said to him, &ldquo;What is the matter with
you?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;nought is the matter
<a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>wi
me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s co&mdash;co&mdash;co&mdash;cold, and you
woodner laugh if you were like me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s wet my
belly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little fellow for once received a washing, contrary, no
doubt, to his wish.&nbsp; After he had dried his face with the
ragged remains of a dirty sleeve, he found his way back to the
green&mdash;I expect his mother would scarcely know him&mdash;and
I went for a stroll down &ldquo;Spectacle Lane,&rdquo; where
gipsies formerly tented and camped in large numbers.</p>
<p>Down this pretty country lane there was a pleasant recess, a
little higher than the road, under the trees, evidently formed by
the gipsies on purpose to have their &ldquo;tents high and
dry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several tents could be nicely sheltered and
partly secluded under the trees in each recess.&nbsp; Water and
game would be plentiful in these lanes a century ago; in fact, I
should imagine such was the case now.</p>
<p>At the bottom of &ldquo;Spectacle Lane&rdquo; stood a large,
fine, old Gothic archway, called by the inhabitants in the
neighbourhood &ldquo;Spectacle Tower.&rdquo;&nbsp; The object and
purpose for which it was built has never been clearly made
out.&nbsp; Judging from all the surrounding circumstances, it
appeared to me that it had at one time been intended as a gateway
to a mansion, abbey, or nunnery which has not been built; or,
what is still more probable, it may have been erected as a
flag-tower for Fairfax&rsquo;s army on its way from Oxford
through Northampton to the battle of Naseby, and from thence to
Leicester.&nbsp; Prince Rupert had gone as far as Daventry to
meet General Fairfax and his army, expecting, of course, that
they would come by Daventry; instead of which Fairfax left
Daventry to the left, and pushed on his way through Northampton
and to Boughton Green, hoping to arrive in Leicester before
Prince Rupert and the King.&nbsp; Fairfax may have expected that
the memorable battle would have been fought in the neighbourhood
<a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>of
Boughton; if so, he, at any rate, reckoned without his host, as
both armies came together at Naseby, and with what result any
schoolboy knows.</p>
<p>Report says that Boughton Green church was razed to the ground
by Cromwell&rsquo;s army.</p>
<p>The fact of gipsies flocking to this, which was once a fine
old Roman Catholic church, and nestling in tents under its
shadows, together with the fact that old, monastic-looking
farm-houses are to be seen in the neighbourhood, confirms the
idea I set forth in my &ldquo;Gipsy Life,&rdquo; p. 146, viz.,
that on the gipsies landing in Scotland, about the year 1514,
from the continent, some of them hypocritically professed the
Roman Catholic faith in order to inveigle themselves into the
good graces of the nobility, so that their pockets and pouches
might be filled with as little trouble as possible; in fact,
righteous gipsy Smith having come from India, he knew well, and
does so still, how to turn religious sentiment to advantage, and
hence he landed in Scotland from France as above instead of Dover
and London, and wended his way through the Midland counties and
southward; and hence we find Northamptonshire, in times later on,
a central camping ground for these lawless tribes of aimless
vagabonds.</p>
<p>About a century ago a number of gipsies were brought before
the magistrates at Northampton; upon what charge has not been
stated.&nbsp; This so enraged the gipsies upon Boughton Green and
other parts of Northamptonshire, that they threatened to set fire
to the town of Northampton.&nbsp; The end of it was that several
of the gipsies, for their riotous conduct, forfeited their lives
upon the gallows.&nbsp; See &ldquo;Gipsy Life,&rdquo; p. 154.</p>
<p>To come back to Boughton Green fair.&nbsp; After having
wandered about &ldquo;Spectacle Lane&rdquo; I called upon a
gentleman, Mr. Jeys, who has resided for many years close to the
green, and he told me that he has seen as many as <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>forty to
fifty tents and vans of gipsies camping in the lanes near to his
house.&nbsp; It was down this lane that small-pox raged among the
gipsies.&nbsp; Righteous Smith, with his two wives, Constant and
Comfort, and a number of their twenty children, died of
small-pox.&nbsp; Births, deaths, and murders have taken place
upon the green.&nbsp; How many nobody knows, nor can any idea be
formed of the number.&nbsp; Mr. Jeys told me of one case, being a
gipsy row, ending in murder.&nbsp; Who had done it no one could
tell, and where the gipsy was buried was a mystery.&nbsp; They
hunted and searched, but, like the body of the Earl of Crauford
and Balcarres, it could not be found, until Mr. Jeys&rsquo;
gardener came across it in the garden.&nbsp; When the body of the
gipsy was found it was laid straight out between two flag stones
reared edgewise, and a large flagstone as a covering.&nbsp; The
arms were folded, and upon the breast of the gipsy there was a
pair of scissors, which had been carefully placed there by those
who had buried the gipsy in the dark; for what purpose I cannot
make out.&nbsp; Gipsies have queer notions about the death and
burial of those belonging to them.&nbsp; The old-fashioned
gipsies of bygone days, more than they do now, paid special
regard to the dead, and on this account they carried the dead
body of the gipsy nearly half a mile to bury it in a
gentleman&rsquo;s garden.&nbsp; The murdered gipsy in his
lifetime was, no doubt, a scissor-grinder, and the placing of the
scissors upon his breast was to remind them when he got to the
other country of what trade the gipsy was&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, if
skulking about the country with an old barrow grinding a few
knives and scissors can be called a trade.</p>
<p>A few years since a gentleman farmer belonging to the
neighbourhood was murdered upon the green, by whom it has never
been found out.&nbsp; All sorts of conjectures, suspicions, and
surmises have taken place upon the matter.&nbsp; Some say the
gipsies did it; others say that some of the <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>unfortunate
class had a hand in the sad affair.&nbsp; At any rate he was
found early next morning with his mouth crammed full of dust; his
pockets were empty, and his soul had gone into the unknown
world.&nbsp; His name is engraved upon the trunk of a tree close
to the spot, which, owing to the growth of the tree and the hand
of time, is fast disappearing.&nbsp; The greensward of Boughton
Green is not a bed of roses; but, on the contrary, I am afraid,
those who have met their last enemy upon this battleground of
scamps have found it full of thorns&mdash;for such it has been to
those who have been murdered or met with death in doubtful
company.</p>
<p>At the fair held in 1826, George Catherall, of Bolton, who was
known as Captain Slash, formed a large gang of about a hundred
roughs&mdash;of whom it was composed, young or old, it has not
been stated, or whether any, and how many of them, were
gipsies&mdash;to rob and murder all upon the green on the night
of June 28th who would not &ldquo;turn it up.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
formed themselves, after being well primed with beer, into lines
like soldiers, and on they went to do their murderous, Satanic
work, calling cut, &ldquo;Blood or money!&rdquo;&nbsp; While they
were carrying out their murderous designs, Captain Slash would
frequently cry out, &ldquo;Now, my lads, form yourselves into
line soldier-like.&nbsp; Blood or money is what we want and what
we shall have.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many of those who had retired for the
night under canvas, or under their stalls, were beaten, kicked,
and not a few were rendered insensible.&nbsp; There were no
policemen in those days, and it was fortunate that a body of
shoemakers from Moulton were close at hand, or there would have
been a larger number of the hawkers and stall-keepers murdered,
there is no doubt.&nbsp; The Moulton shoemakers gave Slash and
his gang what they did not expect.&nbsp; Daybreak showed what a
murderous night had been spent upon the green.&nbsp; Blood,
bludgeons, sticks, broken glass, <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>tables, stools, were to be seen
lying in all directions.&nbsp; The money taken at the fair was
hid in all sorts of ways.&nbsp; The wife of a publican ran with
her money all the way to Northampton in her night-dress.&nbsp; A
hawker of scythe-stones and whetstones told me that he helped his
father to put the money they had taken during the fair under
their cart-wheels.&nbsp; Others dug holes into the turf with
their knives; others hid their money in the hedge-bottom.&nbsp;
Scores were scampering about in their night-dresses in all
directions, with their hair on end, and almost frightened out of
their senses, like stark mad folks.&nbsp; The children nestling
for the night under the carts, tents, and in the booths,
screeched and screamed about in the dark upon the grass half
naked, like a lot of young rabbits when the weasels have been at
their heels, horrible enough to frighten devils wild.&nbsp; The
few old folks visiting the fair every year who can remember the
sad scene talk of it at the present time with almost breathless
silence.&nbsp; Some of them said to me, &ldquo;If we were to live
a thousand years we should never forget it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Captain
Slash was taken the next day to Northampton, and in the end he
was hung upon the new drop.&nbsp; Accounts differ as to how he
met his end.&nbsp; Some say that he died in sorrow and
penitence.&nbsp; One gentleman named F&mdash; told me that he was
not far from him when he was hanged, and walked close beside him
on his way to the gallows.&nbsp; While jogging along on the top
of a cart Slash seemed quite jovial, and as merry as if going to
a wedding.&nbsp; He remarked that his mother had said to him more
than once that &ldquo;he would die with his boots on,&rdquo; but
he would make her a liar for once; and just before the fatal bolt
was drawn he kicked his boots off among the crowd, and one of
them hit a woman who stood next to my friend in the face and
disfigured it.&nbsp; After this startling scene his nerves gave
way, and he dropped tremblingly into eternity.&nbsp; To-day the
skeleton <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>of Captain Slash is to be seen in an asylum at
Northampton as a warning to all wrongdoers.&nbsp; One or two of
his gang were transported, some cleared out of the country, and
the others got off &ldquo;scot-free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The associations of bygone days of Boughton Green being
disposed of, I now began to ramble among the gipsies and others
upon the green.&nbsp; I had not gone far before I saw at the back
of one of the vans a dirty, greasy-looking tramp of a fellow,
with an apron on that might have been washed in boiling tallow
and dried in smoke.&nbsp; In a large kettle before him there was
a quantity of thick yellow stuff&mdash;what it was composed of,
or how and by what means it was coloured, I could not
tell&mdash;and by his side, in an old basket, there were pieces
of almost rotten fish casting forth a sickly odour; and over a
fire upon the ground there was an old frying-pan partly full of
hot grease.&nbsp; I was puzzled to know what this was for, and
what it all meant.&nbsp; I had not been puzzling long before I
saw the greasy tramp taking pieces of the fish out of his basket
and dip them into the thick yellow liquid; he then threw them
into the pan upon the fire, whereupon a crackling noise
commenced.&nbsp; After turning and twisting the pieces of fish
about in the pan for some time, sometimes with his fingers and at
other times with a stick, they were &ldquo;browned&rdquo; in
order to be palatable to &ldquo;greenhorns;&rdquo; and as they
were &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; he took them out of the pan and put
them into a basket, and sallied forth among the throng and crush
of &ldquo;Johnnies,&rdquo; calling out &ldquo;Fine fish, fried
and all hot!&nbsp; Fried fish, all hot.&rdquo;&nbsp; A crowd soon
gathered round him, and with a plentiful supply of pepper and
vinegar he began business in earnest.&nbsp; Well-dressed farmers,
shoemakers, men, youths, girls, and maidens of almost every grade
clustered round him, and the eagerness with which they clutched
and enjoyed the fried fish, bones, and vinegar <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>would have
formed a subject worthy of my friend Herbert Johnson, or W. H.
Overend, the artists of the &ldquo;Graphic&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Illustrated London News.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Smack&rdquo;
went their lips, and I turned away disgusted at the thought and
sight at having found so many simple, gullible beings in the
world, standing ready with open mouths to swallow the greasy
morsels of dirty tramps.&nbsp; It is pleasing to note that all
those who live by frying fish, and also those who live by eating
it, are not of this stamp.</p>
<p>After strolling about for some time I turned among some of my
old friends, Jack, Jim, Bill, Sal, Righteous, Piety, and
Zachriali, gipsies of the cocoa-nut tribes engaged at cocoa-nut
shying.&nbsp; All did not profess to be so low down in the social
scale as the gipsies.&nbsp; Poor &ldquo;Pea-soup Sal,&rdquo; with
a reddish face, who had imbibed a little too much from the beer
barrel, and whose legs were not over-strong, particularly
objected to being classed with the gipsies; in fact, as she
propped herself up by the side of her box of cocoa-nut balls, she
turned up her nose, curled her lip, and staggered at the idea of
such &ldquo;respectable people as they wer-wer-wer-were being
rec-rec-rec-reckoned with the gip-gip-gip-gipsies.&nbsp; They are
a ba-ba-ba-ba-bad lot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor Sal was now overcome,
and fell to the ground.&nbsp; For once in her life she was at any
rate level with those gipsies who were squatting upon the
floor.&nbsp; Her husband, who seemed to be a common-sense sort of
a man, and apparently fairly educated, came to her relief.&nbsp;
If he had not done so, I would not have given much for the
cocoa-nuts, and less still for poor unfortunate Sal.</p>
<p>At times, when business was slack, I entered lengthily into
conversation with him as to what had been the cause of his
getting into such a degrading position.</p>
<p>I learned from him that both he and his wife had received a
good education.&nbsp; The man by trade was a carpenter, and the
woman a dressmaker; but in an evil <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>hour, instead of trusting to their
own abilities, work, and common sense, they had taken the wrong
turning, and from that time to the present they had been going
down hill, and they could not tell how.&nbsp; All they seemed to
realize was that they thought they were nearly at the
bottom.&nbsp; Both have relations well off in the world; and both
have the respect for their family not to disgrace it by vaunting
their condition before the world, and making it known to their
friends&mdash;only to a privileged <i>few</i>&mdash;the
disgraceful social condition to which they had brought
themselves.&nbsp; It is something heartrending, past description,
to see a good tradesman and his dressmaking wife fooling their
time away in idleness, wickedness, and sin, tramping the country,
gambling with cocoa-nuts, living in vans, eating garbage, and
trafficking in poor worn-out old horses and donkeys.</p>
<p>I found in further conversation with this unfortunate couple
that gipsies have invented fresh machinations to kill
farmers&rsquo; pigs, viz., to take the inside of an apple out and
fill it with mustard; and as the women or children are going up
to the farm-houses some of the apples stuffed with mustard are
thrown among the pigs&mdash;pigs are fond of apples&mdash;and the
consequence is the large quantity of mustard in the apple
suffocates the pigs, and nobody, except the gipsies, know how it
has been done.&nbsp; Some other members of the gang will visit
the farm-house during the next day or two, under the pretext of
buying up old dead carcases, out of which to render all the fat
to make cart grease.&nbsp; The farmer replies, &ldquo;Oh yes, we
had a pig,&rdquo;&mdash;or a cow, as the case may
be&mdash;&ldquo;died yesterday.&nbsp; You can have that for five
shillings if you like to dig it.&nbsp; You will find it in the
meadow next to the piggery.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All right,
guvernor, here&rsquo;s the money.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course the
gipsies fetch it, and it forms a relish for them for a long
time.&nbsp; I have known of cases where the pig has been <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>buried for
five days, being unearthed, and turned into food for the big and
little gipsies.</p>
<p>Mr. T&mdash; also told me how cows, calves, and bullocks are
treated by the gipsies&mdash;the consequence is they are found
dead the next morning in the fields&mdash;viz., two or three of
the men will take a handful of hay and a rope, and when they have
caught the cow, they will make it secure, and then the hay is
forced into its throat, and a rope tied and twisted tightly round
its mouth.&nbsp; When suffocation has completed its work, the hay
is drawn out of its throat, and the nostrils are wiped
clean.&nbsp; The gipsies then set off to their camp again.&nbsp;
In a couple of days or so, according to a pre-arranged plan, some
of the gang call upon the farmers to buy any dead cattle or pigs
they may have to sell, and the result is, as in the case of the
pigs suffocated with the mustard in the apples, the cow, calf, or
bullock is taken to their tents or vans, perhaps a few miles
away, and divided among the gipsies.</p>
<p>Some of the gipsies get a living by selling cart grease, which
they say is pure fat, but which in reality is made up principally
of potatoes, yellow turnips, and grease.</p>
<p>The gipsies have found out that &ldquo;shot&rdquo; is not so
good to cure a broken-winded horse for one day only, as butter or
lard&mdash;butter is preferable.&nbsp; The way they do it is to
let the horse fast overnight, and then early next morning force a
pound of butter down its throat.&nbsp; To cure a
&ldquo;roarer&rdquo; a pint of oil is given overnight upon an
empty stomach.</p>
<p>The earnings of cocoa-nut gamblers and others of the same
class vary very much.&nbsp; Mr. T&mdash; told me that he and his
wife went upon Northampton racecourse last races with only five
shillings in their pockets, with which they bought some acids,
juices, and scents; these, with plenty of water, they turned into
&ldquo;pine-apple champagne,&rdquo; and <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>the result
was they made five pounds profit, and plenty to eat and drink,
with a &ldquo;jollification&rdquo; into the bargain, the whole of
which was spent in a fortnight, and they had to commence again,
sadder but no wiser.</p>
<p>It is an error to say that gipsies do not rob each other; some
of them have told me that they have been robbed fearfully by
other gipsies, sometimes of as many as a hundred cocoa-nuts at a
time.</p>
<p>While our conversation was going on some silly beings were
knocking their heads against a boss, for which honour they paid
their pennies.&nbsp; What a satire upon the fair, I
thought.&nbsp; Thousands were running their heads against bosses
more deadly in effect than the spring bosses at which they ran
like fighting rams.&nbsp; I was not much afraid of the heads of
the bossers giving way, my only fear was for their necks.</p>
<p>Behind me there was to be seen another crowd shooting at glass
bottles in the air.&nbsp; These might be said to be &ldquo;windy
customers,&rdquo; and as a rule they were full of
&ldquo;gas,&rdquo; bombast, thin and showy; while those who faced
the &ldquo;boss&rdquo; were thick-necked, with plenty of
animalism about them, and ready for a row.</p>
<p>I did not see many gaudily and showily dressed gipsy girls at
the fair, but I saw a large number of gipsy girls dressed as
&ldquo;farming girls,&rdquo; &ldquo;farmers&rsquo;
daughters,&rdquo; and servants, at work among the easy-going
chaps.&nbsp; Some of the girls&mdash;or, I should say,
women&mdash;held the hands of the &ldquo;silly&rdquo; in their
hands, and they were pleasantly looking at the lucky lines with
one eye, and bewitchingly into their faces with the other, while
they told the geese their fortunes, and the pleasures and
troubles they would have on account of &ldquo;dark ladies&rdquo;
and &ldquo;fair ladies,&rdquo; against whom they were to be on
their guard, or they would not marry the one they loved.&nbsp; In
some cases &ldquo;dark gentlemen&rdquo; were trying to steal the
affections of their young lady.&nbsp; As a rule <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>gipsies
prognosticate evil from &ldquo;fair ladies&rdquo; or &ldquo;fair
gentlemen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course it would not do to be too heavy
upon the &ldquo;dark gentlemen&rdquo; or &ldquo;dark
ladies.&rdquo;&nbsp; A number of &ldquo;shoe girls&rdquo; were
having their fortunes told also.</p>
<p>One of the gipsies had offended a man close to me from some
cause or other, which had the effect of exasperating the
&ldquo;beery&rdquo; man to such an extent that he bawled out,
&ldquo;You might rake hell out and scratch among the cinders, and
you would not find a worse lot than gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hold, hold,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;many of them are bad, at
the same time you will find some good-hearted folks among them, a
few of whom I know.&rdquo;&nbsp; I now turned and had a long
conversation with a gipsy from Kent, and the good woman with her
husband both fell in with my idea of getting the gipsy children
educated by means of a free pass book, and of having their vans
registered.&nbsp; Although busy with the evening meal, it did not
prevent her entering heartily and pleasantly into my plans for
effecting an improvement in the condition of the gipsies and
their children, and more than once, surrounded as she was with
everything the opposite of heavenly, said, &ldquo;Thank you, sir,
thank you, sir; and may God bless you for your efforts to improve
the gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; I told her that all the gipsies were
not so kindly disposed as to wish me success.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never
mind them, sir; all the right-thinking gipsies will say
so.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have spoken the truth,&rdquo; I said;
&ldquo;before you can apply a remedy to a festering sore the
proper thing to do is to probe it to the bottom, and this I have
been trying for a long time to do.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a thousand
times better to get at the root of a sore than to plaster it over
by misleading fiction and romance, as some masculine writers,
fascinated by the artificial charms of gipsy beauties&mdash;so
called&mdash;have been doing.&nbsp; In this late day such efforts
to hoodwink thoughtful, loyal, and observing men, and others who
have the welfare of the nation at heart, may well be compared to
a man <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>sticking a beautiful French butterfly upon a dead ox,
and then going among a crowd of bystanders with a glib tongue,
and cap in hand, trying to make them believe that the rotten dead
ox was a mass of beautiful butterflies, which only required a
shower of coppers and praises to cause them to fly.</p>
<p>No wonder at stable-boys and quacks, the sons of ministers,
and others, becoming bewitched to the extent of having to face
the frowns of friends on account of their gipsy-poaching
proclivities.</p>
<p>My process may have been sharp and painful, and probably it is
so now, but it will be found effective, enduring, and pleasing in
the end.&nbsp; To deal with the evils of gipsying in a manner to
excite the worst side of human nature may be pleasing for the
present, but it will bring remorse and rottenness which no amount
of misleading romance and pleasingly painted sin will be able to
cover.</p>
<p>During the day I was informed by the gipsies that one young
farmer had spent fifteen shillings in bowling for cocoa-nuts, and
a youth not more than fourteen years old had spent five shillings
similarly; this being so, it is not to be wondered at that our
present-day gipsies should be on the increase at the rate they
are.&nbsp; With fair weather, nuts cheap, cricketers out of the
way, and &ldquo;plenty of young uns,&rdquo; it is a
&ldquo;roaring trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When questioning one gipsy woman as to how many of the gipsies
upon the ground could read and write&mdash;I roughly calculated
the number of gipsies to be over a hundred men and women, and a
hundred and fifty children&mdash;she answered me as follows:
&ldquo;Lord bless you, my dear good gentleman, I do not know more
than three upon the green who can read and write.&nbsp; It would
be a blessed thing if they could; but that will never be, as
nobody takes any interest in us gipsies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was tearfully sorrowful to see over a hundred and <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>fifty
children squatting about in bogs, dirt, filth, excitement,
iniquity, and double-dyeing sin, groping their way to
wretchedness and misery, without any hand being put out to save
them.</p>
<p>So far as I could gather, not half a dozen of these gangs of
un-English, lawless tramps and travellers had ever been in either
day or Sunday school.&nbsp; And our civilizing
&ldquo;State&rdquo; has not taken any steps for bringing the
gipsy and other travelling children under school influence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my lads, bowl away!&nbsp; All bad nuts returned;
bowl away!&nbsp; Try your luck now, my young gentlemen; try your
luck; bowl away!&rdquo;&nbsp; Bang went a cocoa-nut off one of
the stilts, flying in all directions, with the oil scattered to
the winds.&nbsp; One thing has often surprised me, that the
gipsies have not had frequently to carry cracked skulls, for some
of the roguish &ldquo;farmer chaps&rdquo; seem to delight more in
bowling at the gipsies&rsquo; heads than the cocoa-nuts at their
feet.&nbsp; It is their quick-sightedness and dexterous movements
that save them.&nbsp; No drone would do to be at the back of the
&ldquo;pegs,&rdquo; or he would have to look out for his
&ldquo;pins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little farther ahead there was a family of gipsies of the
name of Smith, man, wife, and seven children, squatting upon the
ground to take their evening meal.&nbsp; As soon as they saw me
they heartily invited me to join them.&nbsp; Gipsies never invite
any one to partake of a meal with them unless with the whole
heart.&nbsp; They never ask you with their mouths to join them
and in their hearts hope you will not.&nbsp; This is one of the
favourable traits in their character.&nbsp; For a man they love
they would rob a hen-roost to fill his belly, and they would spit
in the face of the man they hate.&nbsp; When you are eating with
them, or, in fact, doing anything with them, you must be as one
of them, or you will have to look out for
&ldquo;squalls.&rdquo;&nbsp; They can bear and respect the man or
woman who, as a friend, speaks openly <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>and plainly to them, but they will
be down upon the man &ldquo;like a load of bricks&rdquo; who
tries by cunning and craft to get &ldquo;the best side of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the first interview they suspect that every stranger has
some design upon them, and, as a consequence of ignorance and
suspicion, they appear to be sullen and reserved.&nbsp; This
feature of gipsy life wears off as they find out that you are a
friend to them.</p>
<p>I accepted their invitation to tea in the midst of cocoa-nut
establishments, steam horses, screeching of the whistles,
horrifying music of a &ldquo;hurdy-gurdy&rdquo; organ, swing
boats, and the screams of giddy girls and larking chaps, trotting
donkeys, the galloping of &ldquo;roaring horses and broken-winded
ponies,&rdquo; whose riders were half drunk and mad with rage,
beating, kicking, slashing, swearing, and banging, till both the
poor animals and their riders foamed at their mouths like mad
dogs.</p>
<p>The old china was fetched up for me, which, Mrs. Smith said,
was over a hundred years old.&nbsp; A good cup of tea was poured
out, the thin bread and butter cut and laid upon a clean cloth,
and I was just about to sit upon an old piece of dirty flannel
that lay upon the grass&mdash;for the grass was at this time
getting a little damp&mdash;when the good woman cried out, loud
enough to shake one&rsquo;s nerves, &ldquo;My dear good
gentleman, you must not sit down upon that.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Smith, the ungracious-nosed gipsy cried out
in a voice as loud as his wife&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you do
you&rsquo;ll get more than you bargained for.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
all alive, don&rsquo;t you see it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Smith saw
that I was anxious to change quarters to the other side of the
tent, and apologized for the filthy rag being there, by saying
that &ldquo;one of the children from one of the other vans had
brought it, and had not taken it back again.&rdquo;&nbsp; We were
now seated, and I was enjoying my tea as well as I
could&mdash;they said that &ldquo;they hoped that I should look
upon the <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>tea as a fairing,&rdquo; and as such I looked upon it
and enjoyed it, for I was both hungry and thirsty&mdash;when a
Northampton baker appeared upon the scene vending his
bread.&nbsp; A little pleasantry was exchanged between the
bread-seller, the gipsies, and myself about the size of the
loaves, the dearness of the bread, and what was put into the
flour before baking to make the loaves white, large, and
showy.&nbsp; The conversation turned upon potatoes and alum, and
the gipsy Smith discussed the quantity of potato and alum there
was in the bread the baker had sold to them.&nbsp; This nettled
the baker, and he said, &ldquo;Bread mixed with potatoes and alum
was good enough for pigs, but it&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; The gipsy
would not let him finish his sentence, but instantly sprang to
his feet, and ran at the baker, and struck him on the breast with
his tightened fist, calling out, &ldquo;Do you mean to say that
bread mixed with potatoes is good enough for pigs, and do you
call us pigs?&nbsp; You reckon us as pigs, do you?&nbsp; You
shall remember this or I am not Righteous Gipsy
Smith.&rdquo;&nbsp; And just as he was running at the
half-frightened baker again Mrs. Smith stepped between
them.&nbsp; An altercation took place, one of the most disgusting
and sickening I ever knew.&nbsp; The baker&rsquo;s wife now came
up, and for a few minutes there was such a storm over the pot as
I had never seen in my life.&nbsp; It bid fair to become a
general <i>mel&eacute;e</i>.&nbsp; I was called in to decide who
was in the wrong.&nbsp; This was no little difficulty, as the
gipsy was excited by beer, and the baker by rage and fear.&nbsp;
The end of it was I calmed them both down.&nbsp; The baker and
his wife sped their way to Northampton, and the gipsy to the back
of his van, to vent his bile and calm his passion, after which we
sat down to finish our tea.&nbsp; This being over, and calm,
peace, and quietness reigning, I gave the children some coppers
and shook hands warmly with the gipsies, and thanked them, and
then turned to another phase of gipsy life.</p>
<p><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>I
began to think that it was quite time to look after my lodging
for the night, and wended my way to Boughton village, some
half-mile or more away.&nbsp; This was a work of no light
undertaking.&nbsp; I first tried to find a clean bed in a quiet
cottage, which, after tramping about from house to house,
knocking, inquiring, had to be given up as impossible.&nbsp; The
poor folks eyed me over from head to foot with wondering
curiosity.&nbsp; They seemed to be puzzled as to my movements,
and as to whether they should reckon me as a gentleman, or a
bailiff, who had secreted in my pockets either a county-court
summons or an execution.&nbsp; I next tried the &ldquo;publicans
and sinners.&rdquo;&nbsp; At first they hesitated about giving me
an answer; especially the innkeeper at the
&ldquo;Griffin.&rdquo;&nbsp; They seemed to wonder whether I was
or was not a parson, spying out the land.&nbsp; The landlady at
the &ldquo;Red Lion&rdquo; was holding out encouragement, until
the landlord, who might be made of vinegar and crabs, appeared
upon the scene, calling out gruffly, &ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t do
wi anybodys;&rdquo; and out I went, expecting to have a stone for
my pillow under some wall or hedge-bottom upon the green.&nbsp;
Fortunately I called at a cottage on the roadside, about a
hundred and fifty yards from the green, to see if they could
oblige me with a bed.&nbsp; After a minute&rsquo;s hesitation,
the good woman, who seemed to have a large heart and a
good-natured face, said, &ldquo;Yes, you look to be a gentleman,
and we will try to accommodate you.&nbsp; Come in and make
yourself at home.&nbsp; Will you have some tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a rest for a few minutes, and as the shades of evening
were gathering round, I strolled upon the &ldquo;green&rdquo; and
found Bacchus was on his throne with At&egrave;, Discordia,
Momus, and Mars as his attendants.&nbsp; Concordia, Harpocrates,
and Pudicitia had not been upon the &ldquo;green,&rdquo; or, if
so, they had been only for a very short time.&nbsp; Broken
glasses, empty beer barrels, corks, pieces <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>of paper,
and stools upside down were to be seen on every hand.&nbsp; The
perfume of burning paraffin, aroma of the beer barrel, and stench
of the brandy bottle met me at every turn as I wended my way
among the wicked, silly, larking, and foolish.&nbsp; Here and
there could be seen girls scarcely in their teens, with the arms
of half-drunk &ldquo;chaps&rdquo; round their waists&mdash;upon
the table before them were &ldquo;jugs of beer&rdquo;&mdash;and
opening their mouths wide as if they would be delighted at any
one looking down their throats as they bawled out most disgusting
songs.&nbsp; In one of the booths between forty and fifty boys
and girls were larking together in a manner that made one shudder
to think of the results.&nbsp; Some of them were threatening
vengeance to their &ldquo;Bills,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jacks,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Toms,&rdquo; if they said a word to them when they got
home.</p>
<p>One of the women struck up, as if she was determined to
contribute her share to the debauch, in squeaking tones
resembling that of a cracked tin whistle&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t go home till morning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till daylight does
appear.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little ahead a rustle, commotion, and hubbub was going on;
of course I must join in the crush.&nbsp; I could not get very
near.&nbsp; When I inquired what was the matter, I was coolly
told that &ldquo;it was only a man and woman fight.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thanks to the excellent body of policemen at hand, it was soon
stopped.&nbsp; Another &ldquo;turn&rdquo; in the distance was
taking place.&nbsp; A gipsy&mdash;a big, cowardly, hulking
fellow&mdash;and an Englishman had long had a grudge against each
other.&nbsp; The Englishman could not get the cowardly gipsy to
&ldquo;fight it out.&rdquo;&nbsp; At last the Englishman offered
the gipsy half a crown and a gallon of beer to let him have one
&ldquo;round&rdquo; with him.&nbsp; The gipsy consented to this
condition.&nbsp; The money was paid and the beer drunk, after
which the gipsy wanted to back out of the bargain.&nbsp; Before
the big gipsy would at the last minute undertake <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>to fight
the little Englishman, the gipsy stipulated that there was to be
&ldquo;no hitting upon the noses.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Englishman did
not like this shuffling, but he agreed to it, and they stripped
for the encounter.&nbsp; For a few minutes they sparred about
until the gipsy saw his opportunity to hit the Englishman full
tilt upon his nose, which he did with a tremendous force
sufficient to break it.&nbsp; When the gipsy was asked why he did
it, he said, &ldquo;I could not help it, my hand
slipped.&rdquo;&nbsp; A little farther on still, I came upon a
policeman rolling an empty beer barrel from the policemen&rsquo;s
tent towards the beer stores.</p>

</a></p>
<p>During the day I did not observe one &ldquo;blue ribbon&rdquo;
policeman upon the grounds&mdash;nor, in fact, did I see one upon
the course.&nbsp; No doubt there were many good and true men and
women upon the &ldquo;green&rdquo; who had gone there purposely
to sell their wares.&nbsp; Would to God that there had been more
of them, and then there would have been less rows, and less cause
for such a body of policemen.&nbsp; The pure gipsy
rows&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a number of gipsies joining in a general
<i>mel&eacute;e</i> of an &ldquo;up-and-down fight,&rdquo; paying
off old scores&mdash;were less this year than they have been
known for a long time.&nbsp; Several times a row was imminent,
but with a little tact and the common sense of the
women&mdash;aye, and of the men too&mdash;it was averted.&nbsp; I
observed a little more sulkiness than usual on the part of a few
of the gipsies, but with a little pleasantry this passed off.</p>
<p>I retired from the hubbub for a few minutes, to stand against
one of the huge trees growing upon the edge of the
&ldquo;green,&rdquo; and while there I heard some gipsies
chuckling over the &ldquo;gingered&rdquo; and
&ldquo;screwed&rdquo; horses and ponies they had sold during the
fair, and arranging which of their party should hunt the customer
out the next day, to buy back for a five-pound note their
palmed-off &ldquo;broken-winded&rdquo; and &ldquo;roaring old
screws&rdquo; which they <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>had sold for seventeen pound or
twenty pound during the fair.&nbsp; A fine-looking broken-winded
horse, &ldquo;roarer&rdquo; or &ldquo;cribber,&rdquo; with the
mark intact, is almost a fortune for a gipsy.&nbsp; During two or
three years &ldquo;while he will go,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;screw&rdquo; is sold and bought in again scores of
times.&nbsp; Many of the horse-dealing gipsies are dressed
nowadays as farmers, and by these means they more readily palm
off their &ldquo;screws&rdquo; upon young beginning town or
street hawkers, carriers, and higglers.</p>
<p>Living in some of the vans of gipsies there were man, woman,
and, in some instances, seven or eight sons and daughters of all
ages.&nbsp; In other vans and tents there was a mixture of men,
women, and children, not of the same blood relationship; and the
same may be said of some of the travelling gingerbread
hawkers.</p>
<p>Those of the hawkers who were rich enough to own a van slept
in it &ldquo;higgledy-piggledy,&rdquo; &ldquo;pell-mell,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;all of a heap.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those who had not vans,
the men, women, and &ldquo;chaps&rdquo; slept upon the ground,
under the stall boards, in a manner which would be a disgrace to
South African civilization and Zulu morals.</p>
<p>In the midst of waning twilight and the gathering of sheets
and rents, some of the gipsy women were preparing for their last
meal before shutting the van doors and drawing to their tent
curtains.&nbsp; Scores of poor little lost, dirty, ignorant,
neglected, and almost naked, gipsy children gathered round me for
&ldquo;coppers&rdquo; and &ldquo;sweets.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
digging deep into my pocket for all I could find, and
distributing them among the children, I bade the gipsy parents
&ldquo;good-night&rdquo; and a &ldquo;good-bye,&rdquo; and then
turned to have a chat and a &ldquo;good-night&rdquo; with George
Bagworth, the steam-horse driver, and his wife, the
&ldquo;popgun&rdquo; firer.&nbsp; George was dressed in his best
large Scotch plaid suit from head to foot.&nbsp; His
&ldquo;hurdy-gurdy steam organ,&rdquo; and &ldquo;flying
horses,&rdquo; had winged <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>married and single, men, women, and
children, round and round, exhibiting their thick and thin legs,
not modestly for the riders, but successfully for George and his
sharp, good-looking, business wife.&nbsp; George was in good
humour with himself and everybody else.&nbsp; He entered freely
into conversation about his troubles and trials in former years,
and of his successes, position, and future views.</p>
<p>He is very good to poor cocoa-nut gamblers.&nbsp; It often
happens that some of the poor unfortunate fraternity arrive upon
the &ldquo;course,&rdquo; &ldquo;green,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;fair&rdquo; without a &ldquo;tanner.&rdquo;&nbsp; A wink
of his wife&rsquo;s eye prompts George to advance them sufficient
money to give them a start.&nbsp; This&mdash;for there is honour
among thieves&mdash;is paid back at the close of the fair, with
many thanks.&nbsp; George pointed out to me again with pride the
vans he had made, and with little greater pride to his artistic
painting of the heathen gods and goddesses, which were the
mainstays of his whirligig establishment.</p>
<p>George&rsquo;s wife hung down her head at the non-success of
her &ldquo;popgun&rdquo; galleries.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it is no use
&lsquo;frettin&rsquo; and cryin&rsquo; over spilt
milk,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said, while preparing their supper
tea.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll join us, won&rsquo;t you, sir? you
shall be made right welcome, and have the best we&rsquo;ve
got.&rdquo;&nbsp; They fetched out their best antique china cup
and saucer, and we three sat down to a box table with cloth cover
to enjoy the twilight meal, with the twinkling stars overhead,
and the gipsies&rsquo; lurcher dogs prowling about the tents and
vans, snuffling and smelling after the odds and ends and other
trifles.&nbsp; Speaking within compass, I should think there
would not be fewer than thirty lurchers skulking under the stalls
as eagerly as if after hares and rabbits.&nbsp; Of course George
Bagworth&rsquo;s joined in the scent and sniffle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mine host&rdquo; was a poacher bred and born&mdash;at
least he had a spell of it in his younger days <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>among the
woods, parks, spinnies, and plantations joining Leicestershire
and Staffordshire coalfields.&nbsp; The twinkling star repast was
finished; hubbub, din, screeching, yelling, fighting, singing,
shouting, swearing, blaspheming, and loud oaths were dying
out.&nbsp; Pluto seemed to be getting tired of his feast; Somnus
was observed stealthily wending his way among Bacchus&rsquo;s
wounded followers, and the vast herds and tribes of poor,
neglected, uneducated, and lost little children living in sin,
pestilential, and vitiated atmosphere with dark&mdash;very
dark&mdash;and black future before them, which the rising of a
morning&rsquo;s sun could not dispel.</p>
<p>As I wended my way to my lodgings I could not help thinking of
Sennacherib&rsquo;s army besieging Jerusalem with no Hezekiah to
deliver.</p>
<p>I had now found my way to my lodgings.&nbsp; Round the family
table in the cottage there were Mr. and Mrs. Gayton, &ldquo;mine
host and hostess,&rdquo; and one or two friends.&nbsp; While the
conversation was going on a party of drunken fellows were bawling
out down the road some kind of song, which I could not
comprehend.&nbsp; Mr. Gayton&rsquo;s sister said it was a song
she knew well; and with a little persuasion&mdash;notwithstanding
Mrs. Gayton&rsquo;s twitching, nervous manner and disinclination
to hear it&mdash;the good woman struck up in a sweet but rather
shrill voice, and in somewhat affecting tremulous tone, the song,
as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Little empty cradle, treasured so with
care,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tho&rsquo; thy precious burden now has fled,<br />
How we miss the locks of curly golden hair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Peeping from the tiny snow-white bed.<br />
When the dimpled cheeks and pretty laughing eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the rumpled pillows shone,<br />
Then I gazed with gladness, now I looked with sighs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Empty is the cradle&mdash;baby&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>&ldquo;Baby left her cradle for the golden shore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the silvery waters she has flown,<br />
Gone to join the angels, peaceful evermore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Empty is the cradle&mdash;baby&rsquo;s
gone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the first verse was ended I noticed again a little
subdued and stifled sobbing, and the mistress of the house wiping
her eyes with the corner of her apron.</p>
<p>I could see that there was some cause for the tear-fetching
tenderness and sympathy that was manifested, and I gently asked
for information, and was told by the good people that during the
last month two of the youngest babies had been sent for to live
in the angel-world where no tears are seen and sighing
heard.&nbsp; A melting, sorrowful sadness seemed to creep over me
as I looked round the room.&nbsp; A parent cannot describe the
feelings, and no one but a parent can feel them.</p>
<p>The cradle was empty in the corner; the lovely little birds
had flown to sing in a lovelier clime.&nbsp; The tender-hearted
mother gave way to a woman&rsquo;s dewy feelings while another
verse was sung, in which I could not help joining, owing to
having passed through similar circumstances.&nbsp; I had lost
more than one little tender lamb, and could enter feelingly into
the motherly woman&rsquo;s misfortunes.&nbsp; I said the children
were not lost but gone before, where there are neither tears nor
the pinchings of poverty.&nbsp; In the midst of the solemn scene
I wended my way upstairs to my humble cot; my softened feelings,
wet eyes, and scalding tears prevented me worshipping Morpheus
till just as the candle was flickering out in the socket.</p>
<p>I then dropped into a dozing sleep to awake at opening day,
after which I bade my friends the gipsies good-bye, and left
&ldquo;the mother bending o&rsquo;er her beauty buds.&rdquo;</p>

122</span>Rambles among the Gipsies at St. Giles&rsquo; Fair,
Oxford.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Saturday, September 4th, 1882, I
found myself travelling southward by the aid of a carrier&rsquo;s
waggon and first, second, and third class railway carriages,
surrounded by gentlemen, clergymen, tradesmen, farmers,
cattle-dealers, labourers, soldiers, snobs, fops, and scamps, and
ladies fat and thin, pretty, plain, reserved, lovable, and
smiling; and as we neared London the sleeping, yawning, gaping,
and slow movements seemed to be giving way to activity, bustle,
restlessness, and anxious looks.&nbsp; Stopping, banging, and
dashing, and on we sped.&nbsp; In the train I had a pleasant chat
with the Rev. Mr. Gibbotson, vicar of Braunston, who related to
me some of his experiences with canal-boat children and the
gipsies.&nbsp; In one instance a gipsy charged him three
shillings and sixpence for grinding his nail scissors; and in
another instance a sharp, clever boat boy of twelve had passed
the sixth standard, and was in a fair way of becoming a pupil
teacher, but in six months spent among the canal children in
floating up and down the country, he had learnt some of their
wicked and bad habits, which had ruined his career.&nbsp; <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>After
changing carriages, I saw at one of the North London stations a
woman, who must have imagined that she was in the country,
creeping out of one of the compartments with her sweet-looking
child of some four or five summers at snail speed, and as if
changing would have done to-morrow.&nbsp; She quietly found her
way to the carriage door and opened it very gently, and was about
to step leisurely upon the platform when the train began to move
off.&nbsp; Her eyes were now opened, and with a wild stare she
tumbled the child upon the platform, and then in getting out
herself she fell upon the footboard.&nbsp; Fortunately for
herself and the child, the guard was close by at the time, and
with the quickness of lightning he seized the child with one hand
and its mother with the other and pulled them upon the platform,
the child upon its face and the mother upon her back, and saved
their lives in less time than I could twinkle my eye.&nbsp; The
child cried, the mother screamed, and the last I saw of them, as
we were rounding the curve, was that a porter was picking up the
child, and the bewildered mother was gathering herself together
as well as she could.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On my way I called at a large block of new mansions in course
of erection, and which my son had in hand, and found a joke very
nearly carried into tragical and awful effect.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;lift&rdquo; was not working well, and a gentleman not of a
classical or ministerial kind, rather than use his legs in going
up the ordinary stairs, preferred using the temporary goods
hoist, and said to one of the men as he was jumping into the cage
against the wish of friends, &ldquo;Jump in, and if we must go to
hell, we may as well go together.&rdquo;&nbsp; They had no sooner
landed at the top of the building and just cleared the cage, than
it dropped to the bottom of the building with terrific force,
carrying destruction with it.&nbsp; One minute longer and they
would both have been in eternity.</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>Having fairly landed in London, I made my way to the
Religious Tract Society, and the Wesleyan Sunday-school Union,
for some pictures, and books, and magazines for the gipsy
children, which were gladly given to me, and with my bundles,
bags, &amp;c., I turned into my lodging in Museum Street well
tired.&nbsp; Overnight I inquired of my host if I could get a
&rsquo;bus or a cab that would take me to Paddington by nine
o&rsquo;clock on Sunday morning.&nbsp; At this question he shook
his head and said, &ldquo;The &rsquo;busses will not be running
so early as eight o&rsquo;clock, and the cabs, what few you will
meet, will be on their way home; therefore you will have a
difficulty in getting your packages to the station.&nbsp; And if
you order one overnight it is ten to one if they will
come.&rdquo;&nbsp; From this answer I could see that my only
course was to be up early enough to lug them to the station
myself.&nbsp; Six o&rsquo;clock on Sunday morning found me
getting a cup of cold tea and a sandwich for my breakfast, after
which I started down Oxford Street with my four parcels, weighing
about three-quarters of a hundredweight.&nbsp; No &rsquo;busses
were to be seen.&nbsp; Here and there were tired, straggling
cabmen wending their way home.&nbsp; As I hailed them they shook
their heads and on they went.&nbsp; I managed to carry my load
about two hundred yards, and then turned off the street to rest,
and to leave the few stragglers moving about Oxford Street
wondering as to my movements.&nbsp; Not far from Tottenham Court
Road I turned off the main street a few yards, and stood with my
back to the solitary passers-by, putting a few notes into my
pocket-book, when I was startled and somewhat surprised to find
two tall young men at my elbow, and without a word one of them
deposited upon the Religious Tract Society&rsquo;s parcel a small
book, entitled &ldquo;A Cure for the Incurable,&rdquo; which I
picked up and read as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;During the journey we were joined by a
young man <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>and woman, the latter evidently labouring under some
distressing bodily infirmity.&nbsp; The young man took advantage
of the vacated scats to place his afflicted companion in a
recumbent position, carefully covering her feet with a
shawl.&nbsp; I gently alluded to her appearing unwell.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;I am just
dismissed from St. Thomas&rsquo;s Hospital as
<i>incurable</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; The tone of her voice, and the
tear which trickled down her pale cheek, instantly awakened my
sympathy.&nbsp; Her four children, one a baby, and her dear
husband, she said, made it &lsquo;hard to die;&rsquo; but she
believed God would care for the motherless ones, and cheer the
lonely widower.&nbsp; &lsquo;The doctors,&rsquo; she added,
&lsquo;say I may live some months, but that cure is
impossible.&nbsp; So I thought I would rather be in my own
cottage, where I could look at my children, and see the flowers
outside my door, and have fresh air, than remain in the hospital;
though I had everything of the best there, and great kindness
shown me.&nbsp; But, ma&rsquo;am, home is home; and my husband
knows how to nurse me better than any one else.&nbsp; I know that
I shall not live long; but I shall die at home, and God will
comfort my dear husband, and will go through the dark valley with
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; This brief interview was deeply touching to me,
and my tears flowed with theirs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as I had finished the hasty glance through the little
book, and was preparing for another &ldquo;move on,&rdquo; I
noticed a tall, emaciated, half-clad young woman approaching me
from the opposite side of the street.&nbsp; Such a picture of
misery I have rarely seen.&nbsp; She did not seem to have more
than one loosely-hung old garment upon her, which, as she walked,
revealed the shape of her figure, which did not at all seem a bad
one; moral deformities had not as yet, to all appearance, begun
to tell heavily upon her frame.&nbsp; On presenting herself to me
she said, in tones of despair, &ldquo;Will you please give me
sufficient to buy me a cup of <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>coffee?&nbsp; I want it very bad, I
can assure you, sir.&nbsp; Do, dear sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her eyes
were red either with drink, tears, or anguish.&nbsp; Poor lost
soul! thought I; and on she went to ruin and death.</p>
<p>I started again, and had got nearly to Oxford Circus, and
deposited my parcels upon the pavement, and was surveying things
over in my mind, when I heard something chirping over my
head.&nbsp; I could not tell where the sound came from.&nbsp; It
was not crying, nor was it either singing or moaning.&nbsp; My
curiosity was set at rest as I lifted up my head to look
above.&nbsp; To my surprise, a young woman with lovely face, and
head studded with &ldquo;curling bobs,&rdquo; was peeping out of
one of the top bedroom windows and delightfully engaged in
throwing kisses at somebody across the street.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Chirp,&rdquo; &ldquo;chirp,&rdquo; &ldquo;chirp,&rdquo;
owing to the stillness of the morning, sounded as distinctly as
if they were near to me; at any rate the kisses were not for me,
and on I trudged.&nbsp; As I passed Holles Street, people, young
and old, with books under their arms and in their hands, were
going to early Sunday morning prayer-meetings, or other religious
services.&nbsp; What a contrast to a gathering of half-drunken
hulking youths and men tumbling and quarrelling about Gilbert
Street, I thought.&nbsp; After receiving not a few insults, I
moved forward by stages till I arrived at the Marble Arch, about
eight o&rsquo;clock, with my face covered with perspiration, and
my hands, arms, and shoulders tingling and aching with a kind of
deadness and shooting pains.&nbsp; Scavenger carts were moving to
and fro, carrying the filth and off-scouring of all
nations.&nbsp; A coffee stall seemed to have been doing a good
business, if the pell-mell gathering, sauntering array might be
taken as a specimen of the quantity and quality of the coffee
drinkers, who might be called the loitering customers of the
&ldquo;pub&rdquo; in search of more substantial beverage than gin
and beer.&nbsp; Near Southwick Crescent and Oxford Square I
passed <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>another coffee stall, more respectable in appearance
than the one at Marble Arch, upon which was painted in large
letters, &ldquo;The Church of England Temperance
Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; I now began to try to make a further move,
when a cabman hailed in sight, who looked as if he were going on
the stand instead of coming off it.&nbsp; A bargain was struck,
and he bowled me off at a rattling pace to the Great Western
station, where I arrived about twenty minutes past eight
o&rsquo;clock, stiff and tired about my legs and arms.&nbsp; In
pacing backwards and forwards upon the platform, I nudged,
accidentally, the elbow of a porter who was taking his
&ldquo;swig&rdquo; at a passenger&rsquo;s whiskey bottle.&nbsp;
Whether the neck of the bottle tilted against his teeth, or some
of its contents went down his bosom instead of his throat, I
could not tell.&nbsp; He did not say much about the accident, but
his looks were &ldquo;awful,&rdquo; and my begging pardon could
not turn them into a smile.&nbsp; Another porter said,
&ldquo;They could do without Sunday travelling if it were not for
the London beer-drinkers.&nbsp; Shut up beershops and you will
gag Sunday trains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some thirty or forty city fishermen, with their rods and tins,
were moving backwards and forwards waiting for the train; they
were evidently going out for a spree.&nbsp; One round
jolly-faced, good-looking porter said to me, &ldquo;They are
going out a-fishing, but it&rsquo;s not many fish they
catch.&nbsp; They catch something they don&rsquo;t expect
sometimes.&nbsp; They are not all fish that comes to their
lines.&nbsp; &lsquo;Many of the city fishermen gets a line and a
tin, and goes into the country and calls themselves travellers,
and turns into the first &lsquo;pub&rsquo; they come to and then
they booze all God&rsquo;s day away, and keep us poor chaps at
work all Sunday instead of going to church or chapel.&nbsp;
Sunday travelling ought to be done away with; at any rate there
ought only to be two trains a day each way, out and into
London.&rdquo;&nbsp; A porter then cried out, &ldquo;Take your
places for Slough, Reading, and Oxford.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>I obeyed
his call, and found myself sitting opposite an old friend, Mr. J.
Seaman, from the <i>Weekly Times</i>.&nbsp; In the train the
brandy bottle was pulled out by a man whose nose apparently had
been too prominent upon his pugilistic-looking face at times for
somebody&rsquo;s bruising machine; at any rate there was an
indent in it upon which cock robin could have sat very
comfortably for an hour piping forth the curses of drink and its
consequences, and the blessing of God&rsquo;s Sabbath as a day of
rest for man and beast.</p>
<p>In another corner was a young woman, dispensing liberally port
wine to her new and old friends around her, bringing to the faces
of some of them the alternate red blush and pale white,
indicating that some monster was at work within them, telling
them that it was wrongdoing.&nbsp; After a three hours&rsquo;
pleasant chat on this bright summer&rsquo;s morning, with my
friend, I arrived at Oxford.&nbsp; After partaking of a cold
lunch, I made my way with my arms full of pictures, books, and
illustrated tracts, to the two hundred vans and covered carts
outside Oxford, near Somers Town.&nbsp; By the time I had arrived
the rain had begun to come down heavily.&nbsp; In wending my way
among the nearly two-mile length of vans, shows, covered carts,
and waggons, I found some old faces who gladly welcomed me.&nbsp;
The road was little better than a puddle.&nbsp; Thousands of
Oxonians were running to and fro, star-gazing, gossiping,
laughing, shouting, and making fun on the roadside.&nbsp; With a
vast number of them Sunday seemed as on other days.&nbsp; Little
stalls of nuts, apples, plums, were on the footpaths.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the pouring rain, the poor little dirty gipsy
children clustered round me in the vans and out of them for the
pictures, books, &amp;c.&nbsp; Poor lost souls! some of them, old
and young, big and little, men and women, might not have been
washed for months.&nbsp; Some of the &ldquo;hobbledehoys, betwixt
men and boys,&rdquo; of Oxford tried to make as big fools of
themselves as they could, and kept shouting <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>out,
&ldquo;Now, governor, they will swallow your bag if you will give
it &rsquo;em.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of the town&rsquo;s children
admired my pretty books, and closed upon me for some, which I am
sorry to say I had to refuse, as they were for the big and little
travellers.&nbsp; In the vans, &amp;c., there would be an average
of four children, two men, and two women, and out of this vast
mass of travellers there would not be fifty who could read or
write.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of the persons,&rdquo; says the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i>, &ldquo;who were committed to prison last year,
60,840 could neither read nor write.&nbsp; Ignorance and crime go
hand in hand together.&nbsp; This is a fact beyond
disputation.&rdquo;&nbsp; In some of the vans I counted eight
children, besides the men and women.&nbsp; In one van there was a
man with a broken leg.&nbsp; In three other vans there were three
men ill.&nbsp; Several of the women had bruises upon their faces,
and two had black eyes, and the children were squatting about
among the mud in the ditch.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Dr.

</blockquote>
<p>Under the vans there were over a hundred lurcher dogs, ready
for anything, including white-tailed rabbits,
&ldquo;shoshi,&rdquo; long-legged hares,
&ldquo;kan&eacute;gro,&rdquo; and other trifles of this kind,
down to a shin-bone of beef hanging loosely in a butcher&rsquo;s
shop&mdash;aye, and a piece of a man&rsquo;s calf if he came too
near to them and was not wanted.&nbsp; Gipsies&rsquo; dogs are so
highly trained that they understand a gipsy&rsquo;s looks; and I
should not be surprised to hear that their dogs can
&ldquo;rocker&rdquo; Romany.&nbsp; The dogs are perfectly masters
of the art of killing hedgehogs, <i>hotchi-witchi</i>.&nbsp; Like
their masters, they go stealthily to work and never
&ldquo;open.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gipsy poachers have been known to clear
a field of hares <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>and rabbits and &ldquo;bag their game&rdquo; while the
keepers have been lying in wait for them over the fence.</p>
<p>Among the vans I came across, for the first time, a
&ldquo;George Smith&rdquo; a gipsy.&nbsp; I have met with any
number of &ldquo;John Smiths,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bill Smiths,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Rily Smiths,&rdquo; but never a &ldquo;George
Smith.&rdquo;&nbsp; This led me to have a long chat with him and
his wife.&nbsp; They are Oxfordshire gipsies, and from what I
learned afterwards they are &ldquo;tidy sort of
folks.&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt inclined to have a long conversation;
in fact, I seemed to feel a greater interest in him on account of
his being a &ldquo;George Smith&rdquo; gipsy.&nbsp; The good
woman and her six children looked almost like pure gipsies, but
such was not the fact.&nbsp; They could &ldquo;rocker&rdquo; a
little only, and got a fair living by gambling in cocoa-nuts and
horse-dealing.&nbsp; &ldquo;George Smith&rdquo; told me that he
never went more than fifty miles from home, and when he bought
and sold horses&mdash;of a third-rate kind&mdash;once he could do
so the second time.&nbsp; All horse-dealing gipsies are not of
this class.&nbsp; Gipsies often told me that they like to see
fresh faces, fresh places, and fresh money.&nbsp; During my
conversation with Mrs. Smith, she said formerly she liked
hedgehogs; but since she had found out that &ldquo;they liked
beetles and snakes&rdquo; her &ldquo;stomach had turned against
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; She went on to say, &ldquo;I am no doctor, but
I am told by those who know, that the yellow fat inside a
hedgehog, which you know, sir, is from the poison of snakes and
adders; hedgehogs are dead on snakes and adders.&nbsp;
Immediately a snake sees a hedgehog it kicks up a terrible row,
and tries to scamper off as fast as it can.&nbsp; No more
hedgehogs for me while I live; and I am sure our George will not
have any.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not one of this family of Smiths could
tell a letter, although they sometimes sent their children to
school a short time in the winter; but, as the good woman said,
&ldquo;Lord bless you, my dear gentleman, what bit they <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>learn in
the winter is gone again in the summer, and they are no better
for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; I told them my plan for meeting their case,
viz., by the registration of their vans and a free education pass
book for their children, with which they heartily agreed.&nbsp; I
left them several pleasing children&rsquo;s pictures, cards,
&amp;c., with which they were highly delighted, and I then made
my way to quell a gipsy row further on, which I found to be, as
usual, over the most trivial things.&nbsp; While I was busy among
the gipsies I saw two young ladies, I might almost say angels,
from Oxford, disregarding the rain, talking and distributing
tracts among them.&nbsp; The tracts were not exactly of the right
kind; children&rsquo;s religious pictorial literature is what is
the most pleasing, acceptable, and useful.&nbsp; Dry tracts are
no better than waste paper; and it is almost a waste of time and
money to distribute them.&nbsp; A little further on were three
gentlemen from Oxford discoursing to a group of gipsy children,
and no doubt they did some good; at least I hope so.&nbsp; If
anything, their excellent well-meant remarks were not made
sufficiently interesting, or brought down to the gipsy children
and adults&rsquo; capacities.&nbsp; A wild, dry anecdote, badly
told, and without a pleasing and practical application, will not
do much good at any time.</p>
<p>In addressing gipsies, and other people of this class, two
things are needed to ensure success.&nbsp; There must either be
the extreme earnestness or the extreme simplicity, and no man or
woman can succeed in winning them over to virtuous paths unless
these features are ever brought prominently out.&nbsp; They must
either be as Paul preaching to the Athenians, or as Christ upon
the Mount discoursing to the multitudes in deeply interesting
parables, put with an irresistible force of love and simplicity;
or as St. John the divine when surrounded by little children,
preaching with but few words, but speaking <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>volumes of
love in sympathetic looks, melting tears, and gentle touches,
reaching tender and obdurate hearts in a Christ-like fashion,
with a power that the devil himself could not withstand.&nbsp;
Love, earnestness, and child-like simplicity brought to bear upon
any gipsy children who are sharp and clever will produce
surprising heavenly results&mdash;aye, and from the gipsy men and
women too.&nbsp; In the gipsy mine there is room for all
workers.</p>

<p>Among this mile and a half of gipsy vans there were some
&ldquo;nice and clean&rdquo; travelling homes.&nbsp; In one I
found a good woman reading to her children by the evening fire,
and the kettle &ldquo;singing on the hob.&rdquo;&nbsp; As I
paddled and waddled over boot-tops in mud, in the midst of this
vast concourse of people young and old, never in my life did I so
fully realize the case of the poor man who had fallen among
thieves, and the action of the priest and Levite, and also that
of the Samaritan.&nbsp; The whole scene depicted in the good old
book seemed to come before me as one vast panorama, exhibiting
human life under a variety of aspects.&nbsp; On the one hand,
drawn <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>along the side of the road in the ditch for more than a
mile and a half, there were two hundred vans, carts, and tents,
inhabited by a thousand gipsy men, women, and children of all
ages, mostly in the deepest depths of wretchedness, ignorance,
misery, and dirt&mdash;of many of whom it might be said that they
were thieves among thieves&mdash;had been travelling all Saturday
night or on Sunday morning to be at the fair in time for a good
place.&nbsp; Gipsies, showpeople, and others of this wandering
class travel chiefly on Sundays.&nbsp; Saturday nights and Monday
nights are, as a rule, their best nights.&nbsp; Some of them had
with their poor bony horses, from &ldquo;shutting-up time&rdquo;
on Saturday night to Sunday afternoon, travelled over forty
miles, and most wretched spectacles they were.&nbsp; On the other
hand, and on the footpath, there were thousands of gentle and
simple, rich and poor, young and old, saints and sinners,
ministers and their flocks, moving to and fro, some of whom
sneered at the gipsies, others mocked, laughed, and joked.&nbsp;
Some were disgusted, and others looked pensive and sorrowful at
the picture of an Oxford Lent carnival being spent in this way on
a Christian Sabbath in the centre of Christendom and
civilization, with its hundreds of Christian ministers within
sight and call, who did not answer to the voice of love or
duty.&nbsp; Well might Washbourne cry out&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our hearts are broke, our harps
unstring&egrave;d be,<br />
Our only musick&rsquo;s sighs and groans,<br />
Our songs are to the tune of <i>lachrymose</i>,<br />

Grosart&rsquo;s</span> &ldquo;<i>Fuller Worthies</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After I had distributed my books, and wended my way to the end
of this long lane of sin and iniquity, I turned to look at the
heartrending sight.&nbsp; There were hundreds of gipsy men and
women, some few of whom had fallen from the paths of virtue,
uprightness, and honesty, and some six hunched <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>to seven
hundred poor gipsy children of all ages weltering in the
ditch.&nbsp; Not twenty children out of this vast number had been
taught at the knee of a kind, gentle, loving mother to lisp in
tender, trembling simple tones, to which heaven and the whole
angelic host stoop to listen with open ears, for fear one word
might be lost&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lord Jesus teach a child to pray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who humbly kneels to Thee,<br />
And every night and every day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Friend and Saviour be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While here I live, give me Thy grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And when I&rsquo;m called to die,<br />
Oh, take my soul to see Thy face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sing Thy praise on high.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My heart was almost ready to break, and the big teardrop
forced its way down my face.&nbsp; Just as I was turning away
with a sad and aching heart, a little sharp gipsy girl dark-eyed,
of ten summers, clutched hold of my hand and coat.&nbsp; She
looked up into my face and said, &ldquo;Eh, Mr. Smith,
don&rsquo;t you know me?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember giving me
a little book and a penny when I was very ill in our van upon the
Leicester racecourse last year?&nbsp; Mother and doctor said I
should die, but you see I&rsquo;m not dead yet.&nbsp; My name is
Smith.&nbsp; There are lots of gipsy Smiths.&rdquo;&nbsp; Before
she had finished her interesting little story a large number of
little gipsies had gathered round me, among whom I had to
distribute, with care and tact, all the pictures and little books
I had left.&nbsp; It was now dark.&nbsp; Fires in old gipsy tin
buckets and on the wet ground were to be seen; sticks were
crackling; lights shining under the vans and in the small windows
and through the crevices and over the top half of their doors;
their evening meals sent forth a variety of odours, ranging from
snail soup to red herrings, dead pig, and hashed venison.&nbsp;
The barking and growling of their lurcher dogs were heard more
frequently <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>and savagely.&nbsp; The thousands of dripping
star-gazers and sightseers, rough and smooth, drunk and sober,
had begun to get pleasingly less; rain was coming down almost in
torrents; nevertheless the children felt loath to leave me.&nbsp;
To the onlookers I could have said, with George
Herbert&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Rain, do not hurt my flowers, but gently
spend<br />
Your lovely drops.&nbsp; Press not to smell them here;<br />
When they are ripe their odour will ascend,<br />
And at your lodging with their thanks appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<i>Fuller
Worthies</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With many caresses, thanks, and good wishes from the children,
I groped my way to my lodging with thankfulness, but in a
wretched plight, suffering from my lifelong
enemy&mdash;giddiness.&nbsp; After five minutes&rsquo; chat with
my round-faced host I mounted, with a hot head, and cold wet
feet, &ldquo;wooden hills,&rdquo; and amongst the blankets and
feathers I snoozed into a fitful sleep, to be startled by wild
dreams and nocturnal noises.&nbsp; In one of my strange flights I
found myself in a dark and dismal-looking place like a
chimney-sweep&rsquo;s underground soot storehouse.&nbsp; How I
got there was a mystery I have never been able to solve.&nbsp;
The only things I remember in connection with my visit to this
dark abode was, the good spirit led me through alleys, by
colleges, churches, chapels, synagogues, and schools of every
grade.&nbsp; Marks of civilization were everywhere visible on my
path.&nbsp; There were ministers and teachers on every
hand.&nbsp; One little narrow backway led me to a small narrow
opening down some narrow, rugged steps.&nbsp; As soon as I
entered, a small door of the colour of the walls instantly closed
upon me as with a spring, and before I had time to look back at
the way by which I entered, I was in worse than a Roman or gipsy
maze.&nbsp; At first a cold, chilly sensation of fright and
terror crept over me.&nbsp; My hair seemed to rear bolt upright
in a twinkle; <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>but this soon passed away after realizing the fact that
I was among friends.&nbsp; There were no windows except one
dismal pane, through which the moonlight gleamed.&nbsp; There
were no candles.&nbsp; The grate was made up of bricks and rusty
crooked old bars of iron put loosely together without
mortar.&nbsp; The fender was of two long shin-bones, and the ends
of it two thigh-bones of a man.&nbsp; The fire was crackling with
sticks and the bones of rabbits, partridges, pheasants, and
fowls.&nbsp; Beetles, cockroaches, toads, and spiders were as
thick as they could creep and stick.&nbsp; A dead pig&rsquo;s
skin badly cured, with the bristles sticking on it in patches,
was laid upon the broken stones on the floor as a
hearth-rug.&nbsp; In a large pot over the fire there were boiling
large pieces of diseased pork in a thickish liquid, which was
stirred every few minutes by an old &ldquo;hag&rdquo; with a
ham-bone.&nbsp; The uneven, broken walls of the room were covered
with greasy grime and filth, upon which were hung pictures of
skeletons, death, coffins, and cross-bones, and most horrible,
murderous-looking men and women.</p>
<p>In the centre of this large, deathly room there was a kind of
long, low, tumble-down table propped up with bricks, old
tressels, and stones.&nbsp; The top was sickly, dirty, loose, and
uneven.&nbsp; Round the room there were scores of men, women, and
children, blackened with dirt, grease, and grime, who had never
been washed since they were ushered into the world, sitting and
squatting upon the floor.&nbsp; Their language was that of
thieving, robbing, cheating, lying, &amp;c.; and their spare
time&mdash;at least some of them&mdash;while the cooking was
going on, was passed with the devil&rsquo;s cards.&nbsp; For a
few minutes all was as silent as death, and then the old
&ldquo;hag&rdquo; placed upon the table the pot which had been
hanging over the fire, after which she handed to each of us in
the room an old broken mug, and told us to help ourselves to what
was in the pot.&nbsp; At this <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>a general rush took place; swearing
and fighting was about to begin in earnest, with the probability
of it ending in murder without the outside world knowing of
it.&nbsp; I was about to begin my sickening share when I said to
the lot of them, &ldquo;Now, chaps, women, and children, in my
country it is usual for us to say &lsquo;grace&rsquo; before meat
and thanks after it on occasions like this, and, if you
don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll follow out the practice
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several of the poor little lost creatures cried
out, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s capital! if it&rsquo;s anything nice we
shall like it.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve not had anything we like for a
long time.&rdquo;&nbsp; I told them to be quiet, and then
proceeded with, &ldquo;Be pleased, O Lord, to grant
us&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; cried out the
old &ldquo;hag.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What did you say?&nbsp;
&lsquo;O Lord?&rsquo;&nbsp; What do you mean?&nbsp; What is it?
who is it? and where does He come from?&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve never
heard the name before.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Let me finish,
and then I will tell you afterwards.&rdquo;&nbsp; I began again
to say grace, and proceeded as follows: &ldquo;Be pleased, O
Lord, to grant us Thy blessing with this food, for
Jesus&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; They now all jumped upon their feet,
and an old, grey-headed man, the picture of a Cabul murderer,
with Satan in his face and the devil in his eyes, along with the
wretched, ragged, lost, and emaciated little creatures, cried
out, &ldquo;Who is Jesus?&nbsp; We have never heard of Him
before.&nbsp; Does He live in a big house? and has He plenty of
rabbits, hares, game, and fowls in His plantations? because we
should like to know.&rdquo;&nbsp; I told them, in a way that
excited their curiosity, as to who God was, and also as to who
Jesus was.&nbsp; They set to their midnight supper like a lot of
pigs.&nbsp; I took a little, but was far from enjoying it.&nbsp;
When they had finished their supper they put their mugs upon the
floor, and the bones they gave to a number of bony,
hungry-looking dogs, a kind of cross between bulldogs,
bloodhounds, and greyhounds, which were ready for any kind of
work between the death of a keeper and a young <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>rabbit.&nbsp; They reminded me very much of the big,
hungry wretch of a dog in Landseer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jack in
Office&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His lean dog scanned him by the
three-legged stool.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Harris</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conversation after supper took place in a language which
they thought I could not understand, as to what was to be done on
the morrow.&nbsp; I was mute now for a time.&nbsp; The children
were to look after and bring home all the eggs, chickens, and
fowls they could lay their hands upon.&nbsp; The men were to
bring in larger game; and the women were to hunt up the servant
girls.&nbsp; Each one had their work allotted them.&nbsp; As a
kind of relief, and in broken English, in which they thought I
would gladly join them, a number of the elder ones related how
many times they had been &ldquo;nabbed&rdquo; and sent to
&ldquo;quod.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of them related that they had been
in the &ldquo;stone jug&rdquo; three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, and up to a score times; yea, even with glee
some of the children gave me an account of the things they had
stolen as they had passed from door to door on their thieving
rambles.&nbsp; Now was the opportunity, I thought, during a lull
in the conversation, to change the subject, and began to relate
some of the beautiful things I had seen and lovely countries I
had passed through; the loving smiles, gentle looks, and kind
actions I had been brought in contact with; the many real,
good-hearted friends I had; the many lovely flowers, delightful
walks, and pleasant companions there were ready to join the
travellers travelling in my country; water was rippling, birds
were singing, sun was shining, and a land flowing with milk and
honey in view, with long life into the bargain.&nbsp; As I
recited these things to them they all&mdash;poor
things!&mdash;stared with open mouths as they had never stared
before.&nbsp; They now drew close to me.&nbsp; Although the odour
was anything but agreeable, I kept on relating to them the
blessings and advantages of my country, <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>till they
one and all cried out, with bated breath, &ldquo;How far is it to
your country, governor?&nbsp; Will it be the same for us if we
go?&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Yes, my good friends, it will be
so for you and more.&nbsp; Will you go?&rdquo;&nbsp; They now
cried out, &ldquo;We will go; but we shall have to trust you to
get us out of this place.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I
said; &ldquo;I will try to find a way out of this miserable hole
somehow or other for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I began to puzzle my brains as to how their deliverance was to
be accomplished.&nbsp; For some little time I pondered the matter
over, when it occurred to me that at the bottom end of the dismal
room I had noticed a place upon the wall which looked like a door
that had been plastered over in somebody&rsquo;s time by pieces
of old rags and paper.</p>
<p>I drew near to it, and scanned it over more closely.&nbsp;
After feeling round the edges of it for a few minutes, one of the
oldest and most wretched-looking gipsies spoke out in hasty
tones, and with an amount of warmth that led me to hesitate for a
moment to hear what further he had to say.&nbsp; He stopped
short.&nbsp; So I said, &ldquo;Well, Righteous Palmer, what is
there behind this opening if I should proceed to find
out?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, a lot, I&rsquo;m told by those who
know.&nbsp; Our place is bad enough, as our old witch knows, and
you know, sir; but nothing like what there is behind that there
&lsquo;opening,&rsquo;&rdquo; pointing with his finger,
&ldquo;and if I was you, my dear good gentleman, I would not stir
a peg to see any further.&nbsp; We should not like to see any
harm come to you.&nbsp; If it had been anybody else we should not
have minded a bit; we would as soon given him a chuck to Nick as
look at him, and been glad o&rsquo; the job, and ground his bones
to powder, and played at football with his skull.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
said, &ldquo;Well now, Palmer, if you do not mind, we will
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do,&rdquo; said Palmer, &ldquo;and get into any
trouble, or <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>into a place out of which you cannot get back, you must
not blame us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you do what you can to
help me?&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes, we will do what we
can for you in any way.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; I now took out my pocket knife and began to cut and
pull some of the paper and old rags off what now was appearing to
be a door.&nbsp; The old witches, &ldquo;hags,&rdquo; and
grey-bearded, bloated, and thin, wretched-looking men, and
swarms, almost, of poor emaciated children, eagerly closed round
me to see what it would end in.&nbsp; The stinking fire was
stirred up to cause fresh light; and in the meantime I kept
cutting away, which was no light task, for there were many old
knots and rusty nails to be faced.&nbsp; Some of the poor
children cried out, &ldquo;By Jove, it is a door!&nbsp; Wonder
where it leads to?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;wait and we will see.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I worked, tugged,
and toiled, sometimes in the midst of breathless silence, and at
others in a gipsy noise loud enough to drown my own voice and
noise of my tinkering.&nbsp; At last the door seemed to be pretty
loose.&nbsp; Nervousness and fear seemed to creep over me more
than ever as I neared the end.&nbsp; Questions kept popping up in
my mind, &ldquo;Where will it lead to?&nbsp; If it did not lead
to an opening and daylight,&rdquo; I said to myself more than
once, &ldquo;I am a done man.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord help
me,&rdquo; I said, as I put my hand to the door to push it or
pull it one way or the other.&nbsp; At last I pulled it
open.&nbsp; There was the faintest light to be seen from
somewhere, but I could not tell where.&nbsp; All the gipsies came
nearer to me, and I said to one of the strongest of them,
&ldquo;Hold my hand, for I do not know where it will lead
to.&nbsp; It will either be to my ruin or your
happiness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We will hold you,&rdquo; cried one
and all; &ldquo;you shan&rsquo;t fall at any rate.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thank the Lord for this,&rdquo; I said, and with much
trembling I took the first step, not knowing whether it was to be
downhill or uphill.&nbsp; In putting my feet out I felt my toe go
against something hard.&nbsp; I kicked again <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>and again,
and found it to be a stone step.&nbsp; I then put my foot upon
it.&nbsp; The gipsies were still at my coat tail.&nbsp; I then
put both feet upon it, and felt at the walls, which seemed to
widen out.&nbsp; A little more light was manifest, but still I
could not tell where it came from.&nbsp; I kept groping and
feeling my way step after step.&nbsp; More light of a yellowish
tint, not of the cold moonlight hues, was now becoming more
visible.&nbsp; The gipsies, especially the children, began to get
eager to see the end of it.&nbsp; First one and then another of
them said more than once, &ldquo;The light seems nice; I wonder
where it comes from?&rdquo;&nbsp; The old gipsies were, with this
light, made to look most horrible, and slunk back, but the
children stuck to me.&nbsp; A great wide passage was now
manifest; and altogether an uphill work was becoming more
pleasant and cheerful.&nbsp; The gipsy children seemed to be
round me by hundreds, and for the life of me I could not tell
where they came from.&nbsp; A more miserable lot could not be
imagined.&nbsp; Some of the children cried out, &ldquo;Governor,
it seems a long way to the top; how far is it?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Another twenty steps brought us to the top in full face to the
rising sun; singing birds filling the air with their chanting;
lovely flowers and beautiful mansions, blossoming trees rich with
bud, blossom, and fragrance; groves, parks, and long walks
without end.&nbsp; The deer were bounding, cattle grazing, and
the big lambs were calling out for their mothers.&nbsp; In the
long winding distance, at the top of a hill, stood a golden city,
whose mansions and palaces were built of large blocks of precious
stones, with an arch spanning over the whole composed of a
succession of rainbows, with rays of glory indescribable,
anxiously forcing their way to add lustre to the scene through
the occasional openings to be seen in the illuminated arch.&nbsp;
My heart was so overjoyed at having arrived at the top, and
seeing vast crowds of little gipsy children brought out of
darkness, I began to sing out lustily, with tears in my
eyes&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a land that is fairer than day,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And by faith we can see it afar.<br />
For the Father waits over the way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To prepare us a dwelling-place there.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ami as if by magic, the children sang touchingly the chorus,
in which I joined&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;In the sweet by and
by,<br />
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the sweet by and by,<br />
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The singing of this tune woke me up, and for the life of me I
could not tell where I was, or whether I was in the body or out
of it.&nbsp; This matter was soon settled by the
&ldquo;boots&rdquo; knocking at my door, telling me that it was a
quarter-past five o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I partook of a hasty
breakfast, and by six o&rsquo;clock, with the musical bells
chiming round me, I was among the gipsies in the fair, some of
whom were settling down to their quarters, others were grumbling,
and in not a few instances rows were brewing, owing to the space
allotted to them not being up to their anticipation.&nbsp; On my
way from my lodging to the town I passed a number of most
wretched spectacles drawn by donkeys and ponies, fit for the
knacker&rsquo;s yard.</p>
<p>Upon a tumble-down donkey-cart covered over with sticks and
old sheeting, drawn by a donkey dressed in harness not worth
sixpence, which was tied together with string and pieces of rope,
there were women and six poor half-dressed, half-starved, dirty,
ragged children.&nbsp; The sight was most pitiable.&nbsp; The
little dirty faces, with matted hair, peering through an opening
in the rotten calico canvas, reminded me of a nest of young
rabbits, rather than human beings with immortal souls, endowed
with reason, thought, and intellect, and in the image of God,
peeping out of their hole among the dead grass.&nbsp; Oh! what a
contrast, I thought, to the architectural grandeur and beauty of
the <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>mansions on either hand as they passed through the
streets.&nbsp; Why and wherefore is the cause?&nbsp; But I must
not stop now to inquire.&nbsp; This problem I must work out later
on.</p>
<p>The toll clerk with an amount of tact managed to squeeze the
two hundred and twenty vans and shows into the square, keeping
fairly the worst kinds in the background, and the best-looking
with their faces towards &ldquo;Lunnun.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have,&rdquo; said the clerk, &ldquo;much to do to get them all
placed.&nbsp; After I have done all I can, I cannot keep them
from rows and quarrels.&nbsp; Sometimes it is worse than what you
see now.&nbsp; There are many more vans than there are in the
fair this morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said to him, &ldquo;How many do
you think there are here this morning?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
sir, there are considerably over two hundred.&nbsp; I counted
early yesterday afternoon in one string between here and Somers
Town, a hundred and seventy-two vans, and others have been coming
since.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this juncture he spied a gipsy with his
van and establishment taking up their abode in the churchyard
under the tall trees.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;I must be off to stop
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; I followed him to see how the bronzed old
gipsy would take to his veto.&nbsp; Fortunately he took to the
dismissal with good grace, and more than once said, &ldquo;Thank
you, my good gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is one of the
characteristics of the old romantic gipsies, when they want
anything by favour; seeing that it is not in their power to get
it either by craft or bounce, they can ask with much grace, and
in this way they often succeed.&nbsp; After the toll clerk was
gone I had a chat with the gipsy&mdash;who, to his credit, had
good cattle between the shafts of his vans.&nbsp; He said that he
had at home&mdash;but did not say where his home was&mdash;eleven
grey horses, out of his stock of thirteen.&nbsp; I took his
statement with a pinch of salt, and moved off, leaving him to
mumble over a joke I left behind, while he changed his
quarters.</p>
<p>Not far from this scene there stood at a van door a tall, <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>bony,
dirty-looking man, in an almost nude state, and a lot of dirty,
ragged children, and the &ldquo;old woman&rdquo; washing, hard
and fast, some dirty linen in a tin bucket.&nbsp; It struck me
that in this case, as with others, dispatch was the soul of
business, and I loitered about to see what &ldquo;shifts&rdquo;
this gipsy family would adopt.&nbsp; Scrub, rub, and a dash into
the hot water went the dirty linen.&nbsp; After two or three good
rubs and tussels with the linen in the bucket, she pulled it out
and wrung it as if she was &ldquo;screwing its neck
off.&rdquo;&nbsp; When this was over she gave it a good shake,
and handed it to her &ldquo;old man&rdquo; without drying.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;old man&rdquo; retired for a few minutes, and then he
appeared with a dirty white shirt on his back, sticking more
closely to his body than would have been agreeable to most
people.&nbsp; Fortunately the warm sun was shining, and by
exposing it to the sun&rsquo;s rays during his pacing backwards
and forwards in the square for an hour, he presented a better
spectacle.&nbsp; At night upon the stage, with his painted face
and coloured pantaloons, his grimy, smoke-coloured shirt passed
off fairly well.&nbsp; I could see that the poor children, who
stood round the door with matted hair, were to have the same
measure dealt out to them that was dealt out to the &ldquo;old
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am not at all surprised to find that diseases
of various kinds should be creeping among our present-day
gipsies, the bulk of whom wash and dry their linen on their limbs
and bodies as above.&nbsp; Among the old gipsies rheumatic
diseases were not known, but it is not so now; and it cannot be
wondered at when we take into account that men, women, and
children cause their bodies to do in wet weather what the
&ldquo;clothes horse&rdquo; should do, and in fine weather what
the &ldquo;clothes line&rdquo; should do.&nbsp; Such is
&ldquo;gipsy life&rdquo; in this nineteenth century, in this our
enlightened England.</p>
<p>One of the horses belonging to one of the gipsy vans had had
nearly enough of it; and for the life of him the gipsy <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>could not
get the poor old horse to stir a peg, except to kick, and this it
could do as well, if not better, than a
&ldquo;four-year-old.&rdquo;&nbsp; I expected every minute to see
the van over on its side, and the woman and children sprawling in
the road.&nbsp; Fortunately, a few fellow-gipsy brothers put
their shoulders to the wheel, and wheeled it off to right
quarters.</p>
<p>In other vans &ldquo;rock&rdquo; and &ldquo;toffy&rdquo;
making was going on with vengeance.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take one
case to show the kind of process carried out, and what
town&rsquo;s children and others have to swallow during feasts,
mops, and fair time.</p>
<p>Surrounded by several vans and carts there was a fire in an
old bucket, round which stood men, women, and a lot of poor
little gipsy roadside Arabs.&nbsp; Presently into the pot over
the fire&mdash;a large old kettle&mdash;a gipsy woman puts a lot
of the commonest dirty-looking sugar, and some butter, or
&ldquo;butterine,&rdquo; and when it has begun to boil, one of
the children stirs it with a dirty stick for a time.&nbsp; After
the boiling process is over, it is taken out and handed to the
man or woman, as the case may be, to be &ldquo;pulled&rdquo; or
twisted into the long walking-stick shape you see on some of the
low, dirty gingerbread stalls attending fairs.&nbsp; A
light-coloured &ldquo;rock,&rdquo; or &ldquo;toffy,&rdquo; is
made by adding lighter-coloured sugar and flour.</p>
<p>The light-coloured &ldquo;rock&rdquo; and the dark-coloured
&ldquo;rock&rdquo; are then mixed and twisted together, forming
what is called the &ldquo;scrodled rock.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mixing
process gives the hands of the mixers a clean appearance inside,
contrasting strongly with the back of the hands, which at times,
with this class of folks, resemble very much in colour the backs
of tortoises or toads.&nbsp; George Herbert, in the &ldquo;Fuller
Worthies&rdquo; Library, might almost have seen and tasted some
such like, when he wrote&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;A sweetmeat of
hell&rsquo;s table, not of earth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few yards from this manufacturing process there were <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>man, woman,
and two little children &ldquo;as clean as pinks,&rdquo; and a
boy, who was scrubbing himself, head and shoulders, down to the
waist, till he was &ldquo;all of a white lather.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This case, and the few others I saw of a similar nature, were the
&ldquo;new comers on the road.&rdquo;&nbsp; I expect to hear of
their rising as a cow&rsquo;s tail grows.</p>
<p>A laughable incident occurred while I was standing by watching
the boy scrub at his head as if he meant to fetch the hair up by
&ldquo;the roots.&rdquo;&nbsp; From beneath one of the vans a big
black dog sallied forth down the fair with a piece of white paper
in its mouth, carefully wrapped up, and much resembling a parcel
of sandwiches.&nbsp; No sooner was the dog in the fair than some
of the gipsies were after it, crying out, &ldquo;Stop it!&nbsp;
Stop it!&rdquo;&nbsp; At first the dog would not listen;
ultimately it stopped.&nbsp; The gipsies came up to the
frightened animal.&nbsp; Everybody expected the dog had run away
with something valuable in the shape of eatables, if nothing
else.&nbsp; One big gipsy cried out to the dog, &ldquo;Down with
it!&nbsp; Down with it!&rdquo;&nbsp; The dog did as it was
told.&nbsp; This was no sooner done than the gipsy picked up the
paper, and began to carefully unwrap it, when, to the horror of
the gipsy and a few others who had taken part in the chase, and
roars of laughter of onlookers, it turned out to be a paper
containing a few bloaters&rsquo; heads and other unpalatable
trifles.&nbsp; The parcel was dropped much quicker than it was
picked up.&nbsp; Another laugh burst forth.&nbsp; The huntsmen
pinched their noses and slunk away.&nbsp; One said, &ldquo;I
thought he had got somebody&rsquo;s grub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I now came upon Mr. Bachelor Nabob Brown, a chimney-sweeping
gipsy&mdash;and a most curious stick he was&mdash;in charge of a
weighing machine and a few other trifles.&nbsp; He was just
turning out of his bed, which had been in his cart, covered with
a yellow sheet.&nbsp; Nine o&rsquo;clock was the time he had
promised overnight to be ready for a stroll.&nbsp; He got up,
gave himself a rub, yawn, and a stretch, and <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>set to work
lighting his fire in the usual gipsying drawing-room fireplace
among the other gipsies.&nbsp; Of course washing was out of the
question.&nbsp; He boiled his water, stewed his tea, frizzled his
bloater, and then set to work upon his breakfast with a strong
smell of paraffin oil pervading the whole of the contents of his
&ldquo;larder.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nabob Brown combed his hair with his
fingers, threw on his patched and ragged old pilot Chesterfield,
and off we started for a tramp to the outskirts of Oxford.&nbsp;
We had not gone far before he began to apologize for not being
dressed as a gentleman, and said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind,
sir, do you, at me walking along with you in this cut and
figure?&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Oh no, I do not mind in the
least.&nbsp; Very few know me personally in Oxford, but it would
make no difference to me if they did.&nbsp; If it would help on
the cause of the gipsy children, I would as soon have my dinner
with a gipsy as with a prince.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All right, my
friend,&rdquo; said Mr. Nabob Brown; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to
hear you say that.&nbsp; I know who I am talking to.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In going along I said to Nabob, &ldquo;I should like to know a
little about your family.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just what I wanted.&nbsp; Let me
tell you, sir, that the &lsquo;Browns&rsquo; are amongst the best
families in the land.&nbsp; In our family are dukes, lords,
M.P.&rsquo;s, and squires without end, and never a one has done
anything wrong.&nbsp; They are all high-class and first-rate
folks.&nbsp; In everything that is good a &lsquo;Brown&rsquo;
starts it.&nbsp; I feel proud that my name is
&lsquo;Brown.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;I thought Smith
was not a bad name.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They are nothing like the
&lsquo;Browns,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Nabob.&nbsp; &ldquo;Smiths
stand second, Browns stand first.&nbsp; I shall come in for a
fortune one of these days before long, and I shall not forget
you.&nbsp; Will you give me your address?&rdquo;&nbsp; I said,
&ldquo;Yes, with pleasure; I shall be glad to have the prospect
of a fortune again for my children&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;All right, give me your card.&rdquo;&nbsp; I handed him my
card, and the poor &ldquo;cracked&rdquo; fellow wrapped it up and
put it into his pocket.</p>
<p><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>Mr.
Nabob Brown stopped, rubbed and scratched in the street, and
commenced again as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am one of fifteen children, and the only one living,
thank God.&nbsp; My father was George Brown, who served
thirty-five years in the Fifty-second Light Infantry.&nbsp; He
was present at the battles of Waterloo, Salamanca, and Badajoz;
after which he was pensioned off.&nbsp; He spent three years in
Chelsea Hospital, and was then taken to the soldiers&rsquo;
madhouse at Norwich, and there he died.&nbsp; People say that I
am getting like him, but they are fools and don&rsquo;t know what
they are talking about.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m as sensible as any man in
the country&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;&nbsp; I told
him I did &ldquo;not like answering questions of that kind
without longer experience.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My father was of a
drunken family, and it was in one of his drunken fits when he
tumbled me downstairs and put out one of the joints of my
backbone.&rdquo;&nbsp; We now came to a dead stand opposite one
of the colleges and near to some large houses.&nbsp; People big
and little, gentle and simple, were passing to and fro.&nbsp; He
now turned his back towards me and bent his bead low to the
wall.&nbsp; He then turned up the tail ends of his old coat,
exhibiting his under ragged garments, and took hold of my hand
and poked my finger into a small dent in the slight bend upon his
back.&nbsp; Of course I consented.&nbsp; He next took off his old
hat and poked my finger into a hole upon his head.&nbsp; All the
time his tongue was going at the rate of &ldquo;nineteen to the
dozen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Nabob&rsquo;s arms began to swing
backwards and forwards, and he shouted out, &ldquo;I live by
excitement; without it I should die.&rdquo;&nbsp; Children began
to stare and gather round us, but before doing so I said,
&ldquo;I suppose you cannot stand drink?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh
dear no! I have been teetotal these twenty-five years, on and
off, and am religions in my heart, but I doesn&rsquo;t always
show it.&nbsp; I goes to church sometimes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a
Church of England man; but then you know, sir, we in our
profession cannot do without <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>telling lies sometimes.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m giving up all bad things, women and everything
else.&nbsp; If it was not for being religious at my heart I
should have been dead long ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; He now began to
&ldquo;dance and caper about the road.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fortunately
we were close to the grounds round Christ Church College, and
very few saw his megrims.</p>
<p>We had now arrived opposite a small conservatory with some
beautiful flowers in view.&nbsp; The pretty flowers sent Mr.
Bachelor Nabob Brown off at a tangent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
said Mr. Brown, &ldquo;I love flowers.&nbsp; It is delightful to
be among flowers.&nbsp; I could die among flowers.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m a first-rate gardener.&rdquo;&nbsp; The names he gave
to some of the commoner sorts of flowers he saw were anything but
Latin or English.&nbsp; The small rivulet, green meadows, tall
trees, pleasant walks, with the burning sun shining overhead,
seemed to have excited Mr. Nabob&rsquo;s dormant artistic
qualities, and he commenced to give me specimens of his musical
abilities.&nbsp; After he had done he said, &ldquo;I never had
any regular training, or I should have been one of the
&lsquo;stars;&rsquo; as it is I can play the fiddle, concertina,
piano&mdash;in fact, I should not be stuck fast at
anything.&nbsp; I consider myself to be a regular musician, and
no mistake.&nbsp; Oh, my back and my head, sir.&nbsp; Let us sit
down for a chat under one of these trees.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All
right,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am quite ready.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Several gentlemen and ladies paced backwards and forwards, no
doubt wondering who we were or what our movements meant.&nbsp;
Maybe, for aught I know, that some of them thought that we had
dynamite designs upon Christ Church College; or that we were
&ldquo;two poor wandering lunatics.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Nabob Brown
next poured forth his other qualifications&mdash;adaptability and
practice in photography, jewelling, shop-keeping, selling
tobacco, sweets, and fruits.&nbsp; His recital of these things
brought him upon his feet again; and he shouted out with his arm
aloft, &ldquo;Would you believe me, sir?&nbsp; I lost over a
hundred pounds in &lsquo;dissolving views.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; I
told <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>him
jokingly that I was not surprised at it.&nbsp; &ldquo;There were
so many wicked men in the world who have not brains and force of
character sufficient to carry them through the difficulties of
life, and therefore their only course was to get upon
somebody&rsquo;s back and allow themselves to be carried to a
safe place.&nbsp; I have seen many men of this class in my
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Right you are, sir.&nbsp; That is just
how I have been served through life.&nbsp; I have not only had my
brains run away with, but my coat off my back; aye, and one time
a big black dog ran away with a piece of my leg.&nbsp; Oh!
oh!&rdquo; shouted Brown, with a twinged face, &ldquo;gipsies are
terrible devils.&nbsp; We are a bad lot, but I don&rsquo;t like
to tell everybody, nor do I like to say all I know, or they would
be down upon me at the next fair, and I should have no peace in
my life; I might as well be hung.&nbsp; Give it the policemen; I
don&rsquo;t like them chaps, they are no good to anybody.&nbsp;
Blow me!&rdquo; Nabob cried out as we came to a sudden stop on
the road, &ldquo;I left my old umbrella in my cart when we
started, and I&rsquo;ll bet a farthing it will be gone when we
get back; let&rsquo;s be off.&rdquo;&nbsp; So we began to trot
off together, leaving the austere, grim walls of Christ&rsquo;s
College to stand the rude and rugged storms of centuries from
without, and the assaults of dogmas, creeds, divinity, law,
philosophy, moral force, and logic from within.&nbsp; On our way
he told me of the tricks practised by the stall-keeping gamblers
upon their wheels of fortune, and the hoodwinking process the
policemen undergo at fair times.</p>
<p>We had now arrived at the post office, and Brown said,
&ldquo;Just one word before we part,&rdquo; and I chimed in,
&ldquo;Perhaps never to see each other again.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I say, sir, I quite agree with you that all our travelling
children should receive a free education as you propose, and the
publicans should be made to pay for it.&nbsp; Good-bye, sir, and
God bless you,&rdquo; and away he popped out of sight into the
post office, and I sauntered into the fair.</p>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>In
charge of a gambling cocoa-nut concern I noticed a gipsy named
I&mdash;, with his hand tied up, which he said was brought about
by blood-poisoning.&nbsp; In the van were two brothers and one
sister.&nbsp; Connected with this family there were seventeen
brothers and sisters, together with father and mother, making a
total of nineteen human beings.&nbsp; And only one out of the
whole could read and write, and this one, to his everlasting
credit, had early in life given up gipsying and put himself out
as an apprentice to engineering, and during his apprenticeship he
had, unaided by any teacher except his workmates, taught himself
to read and write.&nbsp; All honour to such men, be they gipsies,
canal boatmen, or brickmakers.&nbsp; As I noticed his good
brother, who had run over to the fair for a day to assist his
lame brother and their sister, I could not help seeing the vast
contrast between the two men.&nbsp; Self-help and education had
raised one from a gipsy tramp to the position of an engineer at a
salary of thirty-five shillings per week, with his nights to
himself.</p>
<p>I next turned again to my friend George Smith, the gipsy, who,
with his wife and six children, were attending to their cocoa-nut
concern.&nbsp; George Smith was just having his lunch, to which
he invited me.&nbsp; Of course I joined him, notwithstanding the
crush of the fair.&nbsp; Smith did not know of more than one
gipsy among all their relations who could read and write.</p>
<p>Early in the morning I paid a visit to one of the vans, and
there saw a woman and her six little girls, and one little boy
about three years old, in a most wretched, dirty condition.&nbsp;
They were thin, and some of their young faces looked prematurely
old.&nbsp; She knew me, and the poor slave of a mother seemed
ashamed of their condition.&nbsp; I gave them a lot of pictures,
cards, &amp;c., and left them to make their way.&nbsp; It was
heartrending to see the poor pretty children scan the pictures,
anxious to know what they were about, <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>but unable to tell a letter.&nbsp;
Despair seemed to come over their faces, as they turned them over
and over and from side to side.&nbsp; Later on in the afternoon I
again paid a visit to them.&nbsp; Of course in the morning I was
behind the scenes; but in the afternoon more phases appeared;
they were in &ldquo;public.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the van was
wretchedness and misery, and all the other evils attending such a
course of life; but on the &ldquo;boards&rdquo; they were
fairies, dressed in lively pretty colours, dancing, skipping, and
riding about, not from love, but from pressure and force.&nbsp;
You could see as the six pretty children danced about that their
smiles were forced.&nbsp; I saw them about six months since, and
I now noticed a marked haggard change in their features.&nbsp;
The husband had the &ldquo;light end of the stick.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He fared well, and did well, and worked but little.&nbsp; I could
hear the chaps round me say of the mother, as she moved to and
fro upon the platform, or outdoor stage, and whose fanciful
dresses were none too long, that it was her &ldquo;legs&rdquo;
that drew the crowds round their establishment.&nbsp; Others said
she was &ldquo;well limbed.&rdquo;&nbsp; She certainly was more
presentable in the evening than in the morning.&nbsp; In my
opinion it was the little girls who were the mainstay of the
concern.</p>
<p>I could not help noticing the vast number of clergymen moving
about.&nbsp; The prettily dressed, and not bad-looking woman had
charms for some of them&mdash;old and young.&nbsp; She had a good
head of black hair, as most gipsies have.&nbsp; Probably her
witching eyes and tresses tickled the fancies of the clerical
onlookers.&nbsp; One grave-looking clergyman walked up the fair
very sedately, not seeming to notice such nonsense, but I could
see him glancing out of the corner of his eye at the woman and
her children as they danced about.&nbsp; It may be that he was
there for the same purpose as I was, viz., to see both sides of
gipsying, the evil and the good.&nbsp; If such was the case, I am
sure that he found it like the Irishman found his wife, nearly
&ldquo;all bad and no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>In
the fair, and with smiling looks, pleasant tongue, and busy hand,
was Mr. Wheelhouse, the Oxford city missionary, trying to sell
his heavenly books.&nbsp; A few came and looked, and turned away,
notwithstanding the low prices at which he offered his
soul-saving wares.&nbsp; Trash! bosh!&nbsp; Dash and a splash
into the Oxford English gipsying was what the crowd wanted, and
some of them had it to their heart&rsquo;s content, with shadows
of the morrow&rsquo;s sorrows hanging over them as they dived
deep into sin.&nbsp; Occasionally the missionary would have a
customer, which caused him to smile like a full-blown rose.</p>
<p>The good old man, as he gave me a parting grip, said,
&ldquo;God bless you in your noble work.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve long
wanted to see you.&nbsp; God bless you, good-bye,&rdquo; and he
gave me an extra squeeze, and I then jostled into the crowd.</p>
<p>I noticed three or four of the most respectable gipsy-looking
men soliciting subscriptions.&nbsp; It could not be for taxes, I
thought, for gipsies never pay taxes&mdash;at least those who do
not hawk and don&rsquo;t live in houses.&nbsp; I inquired what
their loss was, and I was told that a young woman, one of the
mainstays of one of the establishments in the fair, had been
burnt to death the previous week in one of the vans.&nbsp; The
organ, van, and contents had gone to the winds, and the poor
woman&rsquo;s charred black remains consigned to the cold, cold
sod, and tears and black crape left to tell the tale.&nbsp; How
she came to her untimely end was not fairly cleared up at the
inquest.&nbsp; When the great book is opened it will be made
clear.&nbsp; I gave them some silver, and when they asked in what
name it was to be entered, of course I told them, and they opened
their eyes with wondrous curiosity and amazement.&nbsp; I shook
hands with them, and for some minutes I was lost in the
crowd.&nbsp; I suppose they had been told by wicked outsiders
that I had nothing but hard words for the gipsies and
travellers.</p>
<p>A big, idle, hulking-looking fellow of a gipsy now <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>&ldquo;boned&rdquo; me.&nbsp; He wanted me to lend him
a shilling&mdash;as he said&mdash;for his wife and
children.&nbsp; I tackled him.&nbsp; I asked him what he was
doing in the fair.&nbsp; He said he was a collier out of
work.&nbsp; I asked him to let me look at his hands.&nbsp; After
shuffling about a little he let me look at his hands.&nbsp; I
could see plainly that he was not a collier.&nbsp; I said,
&ldquo;You have not had a &lsquo;coal-pick&rsquo; in your hands
to work with it in your life.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this he seemed to
get into a rage.&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;The marks you show me have
been done upon the &lsquo;wheel of fortune&rsquo; in the
&lsquo;stone jug.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; This he did not deny.&nbsp;
When I asked him about the prices colliers have per ton for
getting coal he was nonplussed.&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Now, before
I give you anything, I want to see your wife and four
children,&rdquo; and away we started to find them, on their way
to Banbury.&nbsp; I turned back; but still the fellow was boring
me to lend him a shilling, and he vowed and vowed that he would
repay me the amount.&nbsp; At this juncture he bolted into a
stationer&rsquo;s shop for a piece of paper, upon which he wanted
me to write my address, so that he might send me the shilling
back.&nbsp; I followed him into the shop, and quite a scene
ensued.&nbsp; The gipsy tramp could neither beg a piece nor buy
it.&nbsp; At last, after ten minutes&rsquo; wrangling over a
piece of paper, the shopman gave him an old envelope, and we came
out of the shop.&nbsp; Nothing would serve his purpose but that I
was to write my address.&nbsp; So to please, and to get rid of
the ignorant, idle, dirty scamp, I wrote upon the recently begged
old envelope, &ldquo;Jupiter Terrace, Moonlight Street,
Starland.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fellow wrapped it up very carefully,
and put it into his pocket, and I then gave him sixpence and left
him, telling him that he was to send the amount in postage
stamps, as I could not get post-office orders cashed at the
address I had given him.&nbsp; I expect the sixpence and the
gipsy tramp are on the wing still.</p>
<p>In the fair there were over fifteen gambling
tables&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>tables upon which there were all
kinds of gipsy nick-nacks and fairy trifles, some of which were
sold and others gambled for.&nbsp; On the table there was a large
painted wheel, something like a clock-face or compass, with a
swinging finger or hand.&nbsp; Round the outer edge of the wheel
stood a lot of things, chiefly ornamental children&rsquo;s toys
in fern cases, fancy boxes, and other ornaments.&nbsp; Those who
wanted to &ldquo;try their luck&rdquo; had to put down a penny
opposite the thing they fancied.&nbsp; When several had done
this, and the pennies were studded about the wheel, then swing
went the finger round and round till it stopped&mdash;seldom
where the pennies were.&nbsp; The finger seemed to either just go
past the mark or to stop short of it.&nbsp; All blanks and no
prizes seemed to be the order of the day.&nbsp; I saw one lady
dressed in silk, with a lot of young women, girls, and boys round
her, gamble several shillings away on the &ldquo;wheel of
fortune.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a most pitiable sight to see the
vast numbers of well-dressed young persons and children receiving
their first lessons in gambling, in the shadows of churches and
colleges.&nbsp; I was told, by those who knew, that the
&ldquo;wheels of fortune&rdquo; and &ldquo;shows&rdquo; made more
money than all the other things in the fair put together.&nbsp;
It was a sunny fair for the gambling stall-keepers, but not for
the patron saint under whose auspices it was held.&nbsp; I rather
fancy the saints of bygone days, to whom the colleges and
churches were dedicated, would look down upon the assembly with
abashed countenances at the work of sin going on under the shadow
of the Oxford sacred precincts, and, it would seem, had retired
in favour of Discordia, Momus, Mars, et Pluto.&nbsp; The big and
little gamblers could win when the proprietors thought well to
allow the smiles of fortune to descend upon them.&nbsp;
Fortune&rsquo;s smiles consisted in the pressing of the
stall-keeper&rsquo;s thigh against a stud, that operated
underneath the top of the table against the swivel upon which the
finger <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>or hand was placed, and he could stop it whenever he
liked.&nbsp; After many blanks he would let one of his fools
occasionally win, just to encourage others.</p>
<p>I was put up to this move by one of the gipsies, but with
strict injunctions that I was not to let the
&ldquo;cat&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, my
informant&mdash;&ldquo;out of the bag.&rdquo;&nbsp; When I told
my friend the gipsy that gambling of this kind was against the
law, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the
&lsquo;bobbies&rsquo; are down upon us in some places for it; and
they would no doubt have been so here, but they have been
&lsquo;squared.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; When he talked about
&ldquo;squaring,&rdquo; I thought I would &ldquo;try&rdquo; him
and &ldquo;prove&rdquo; him, but found him to be blank.&nbsp; I
found out that this &ldquo;squaring&rdquo; process consisted in
blinding the policemen with &ldquo;silver-dust.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
fact is this kind of gambling is growing to an alarming extent in
the country under the policemen&rsquo;s noses, and this they know
right well, and take no steps to stop it.&nbsp; Of course the
Oxford police as a body of men could not be held accountable for
the dereliction of duty by a few of them.&nbsp; As a whole they
are a fine lot of village soldiers.</p>
<p>I next turned my step towards one of the shows.&nbsp; There
was upon the platform, or stage, a sharp little fiery woman
beating the drum&mdash;which sounded like a kitchen
table&mdash;and bawling out till she was hoarse, &ldquo;Now,
ladies and gentlemen, if you want to see the best show in the
fair, now is your time; they are just going to begin.&nbsp; Come
up quick, and take your places,&rdquo; and she banged again at
the old drum as if she was going to knock the bottom out.&nbsp;
Beside the sharp, ready-tongued woman stood &ldquo;Boscoe,&rdquo;
dressed, daubed, and painted like a Red Indian, whose rough
visage and broken nose had the appearance of having been in many
a &ldquo;fisticuffing&rdquo; encounter.&nbsp; Although he was
daubed over, I recognized him as one with whom I had had a long
chat on Sunday afternoon, and who pleasantly received some of my
books for his children.&nbsp; Boscoe noticed <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>me in the
crowd, and gave me a few of his sly winks while the megrims were
going on.&nbsp; Close to &ldquo;Boscoe&rdquo; stood a tall,
wretched, half-starved, red-faced looking man, the picture of a
beer-barrel in his face, with red-herring tendencies from the
shoulders downwards.&nbsp; On the ground there were his wretched,
lantern-jawed wife and their six ragged children.&nbsp; Their
home was a donkey cart covered over with rags, and a bed of rags
was what those eight human beings had to lie upon, and I could
have said with Burns&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Oh, drooping
wretch, oppressed with misery!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and as she stood cowering and trembling I could have said with
Crashaw, &ldquo;Oh, woman!&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Upwards thou dost weep;<br />
Heaven&rsquo;s bosom drinks the gentle stream.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should like to have whispered in her ear, &ldquo;Weep on,
poor woman, weep on.&nbsp; Weep on, poor children, weep on.&nbsp;
Your tears will bring down the mighty arm of the Great Living
Father, which shall deliver you from this wretched tramping life
of misery and degradation.&nbsp; Look up! look up!&nbsp; His hand
draweth nigh.&nbsp; The Friend of the children hears the
children&rsquo;s cries, and woe be to the nation or people who
step in to prevent the gipsy children receiving the embraces of a
loving heavenly Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the performance &ldquo;Boscoe&rdquo; came off the stage
and invited me to go into the &ldquo;show,&rdquo; which
invitation I accepted, and was led in by the side door.&nbsp; I
witnessed &ldquo;Boscoe&rsquo;s&rdquo; tricks, such as eating
fire, making leaden bullets, putting a red-hot poker down his
throat, and drawing a red-hot bar across his tongue, and the
bending of red-hot iron bars with his feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
are dodges in every trade, except rag-gathering,&rdquo; said the
old rag-woman the other day, as she sat by the side of the brook,
wetting <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>her rags before she sold them.&nbsp; The acrobat
performances of a poor boy about twelve were cruel in the
extreme.&nbsp; After one of his movements I could see that the
poor thin-faced lad was suffering intense pain by his twinging
and limpy walk.&nbsp; This poor specimen of humanity could not
read or write a sentence.&nbsp; To bend, twist, twirl, and
contort the limbs and bones of a poor child to bring smiles upon
the faces of fools&mdash;for they are no better who witness such
exhibitions&mdash;is hellish, and money gotten in this way
provides those engaged in it with &ldquo;workhouse&rdquo; and
&ldquo;spittles&rdquo; uniform.&nbsp; Other performances, such as
a pony telling fortunes, &amp;c., brought the entertainment to a
close.&nbsp; On coming away old &ldquo;Boscoe&rdquo; came off the
stage to shake hands with me among the crowd, which circumstance
seemed to puzzle some of the bystanders.</p>
<p>I had a turn round with the gingerbread and toy stall-keepers,
and I was not long among them before I found out two old
&ldquo;backsliders,&rdquo; one of whom was from Northampton, and
until two years ago was a &ldquo;member of a class.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now, with her son, she was tramping the country, and attending
fairs and races in the daytime, and sleeping under their stall at
night!&nbsp; A chat with her about old times, and the
&ldquo;blessed seasons&rdquo; she once had, and the peace of mind
she once enjoyed, brought scalding tears to her eyes, as
copiously as if I had been talking to her of the death of a
darling rosy-checked, curly-headed little boy, whose little wax
taper flickered out as its soul was being wafted to Paradise in
the midst of a convoy of angels.&nbsp; The good woman with
quivering lips said, &ldquo;Do you remember giving me, sir, at
Long Buckby, a little book and a picture card?&rdquo;&nbsp; I
said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I sent them to my
son, who is a soldier in South Africa, and they pleased him very
much.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could see that I could press the subject a
little nearer home, and I said to her, &ldquo;How do you get on
with this kind of life?&nbsp; How do you manage <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>to say your
prayers at night?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;this kind of life is not the right thing, and I am not
what I ought to be; but somehow or other I say my prayers at
night, and feel safer after it.&nbsp; I hope to give up
travelling and settle down again.&rdquo;&nbsp; While moistened
sorrow was reddening her eyes, I said in substance if not in
words&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a star about to drop<br />
From thine eye, its sphere;<br />
The sun will stoop to take it up.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a deep, deep-drawn sigh she bade me good-night several
times over, and the curtain dropped.</p>
<p>I now came upon a man and woman sitting at a weighing
machine.&nbsp; (I might state that I was weighed at two different
weighing machines in the fair.&nbsp; Nabob Brown&rsquo;s machine
put me down at eleven stone ten pounds, and F&mdash;&rsquo;s
machine showed that I weighed twelve stone and eleven
pounds.)&nbsp; Both looked above the ordinary kind of
gipsies.&nbsp; The clean, good-looking woman was nursing a baby,
and trying the weight of &ldquo;ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; and
the man was &ldquo;ringing&rdquo; his cheap fashionable sticks
off to those who would try &ldquo;three throws a
penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This couple, I soon found out, were Primitive Methodist
&ldquo;backsliders.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their names were F&mdash;
although they were known among the travellers as W&mdash;.&nbsp;
His father was one of the oldest local preachers in the Brinklow
district.&nbsp; He had worked hard in the cause of the Great
Master, and had succeeded in raising a &ldquo;Band of
Hope,&rdquo; two hundred members strong, in one of the London
districts; but in the fulness of his heart, and in what turned
out to be an evil moment for him, he admitted another
&ldquo;brother&rdquo; as a co-secretary, who, instead of helping
my friend the gipsy in the good work, supplanted him, and
&ldquo;collared&rdquo; the tea-cake, at which the committee
winked.&nbsp; This worked up the tender feelings of my gipsy <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>friend to
such a pitch that he withdrew from the society he had raised, and
took the downhill turning, and in this course both he and his
wife are, at the time of writing this, gipsying the
country.&nbsp; Richard Crashaw says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These are the knotty riddles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose dark doubts<br />
Entangle his lost thoughts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fast getting out.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked my friend F&mdash; a few questions about the gipsies
he had been mixed up with.&nbsp; Among other questions was the
following.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, Mr. F&mdash;, how many gipsies and
travellers have you known, during your travels, to attend a place
of worship on Sundays?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said
Mr. F&mdash;, &ldquo;you ask me a straightforward question and I
will give you a straightforward answer.&nbsp; I do not remember
ever having seen one.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;This state of
things is truly awful.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;it is no more awful than true.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m getting
tired of it, and I think I shall settle down this next
winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long conversation with them both brought out tears, downcast
looks, and sighs, which contrasted somewhat strangely with the
yelling &ldquo;fools,&rdquo; &ldquo;clowns,&rdquo; and simpletons
in the fair.&nbsp; I gave them and their children some books,
pictures, &amp;c., and they in return gave me a walking stick as
a &ldquo;keepsake,&rdquo; which I shall preserve; and after
shaking hands several times over, I toddled off into the fair, to
wander among the vans with my &ldquo;keepsake&rdquo; stick in my
hand, gently tapping the gipsy children as they turned up their
smiling faces.</p>
<p>It was now about eleven o&rsquo;clock, the buzz and din of
fools, wise men and simple, was getting gradually less.&nbsp; The
echo was getting fainter and fainter.&nbsp; The crowd was
thinning.&nbsp; Policemen seemed to be numerous; the gipsies dogs
were sneaking from under the vans, and prowling <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>after bones
and thrown-out trifles.&nbsp; The swearing of drunken gipsies was
heard more distinctly than ever.&nbsp; The gipsy women&mdash;some
of whom had &ldquo;had a little too much&rdquo;&mdash;were loud
in their oaths and hard words.&nbsp; In many instances blows
threatened to be the outcome.&nbsp; Children were screaming, and
big sons and daughters were quarrelling.</p>
<p>Half-past eleven arrived, and the inmates of the two hundred
and twenty vans and shows, numbering about a thousand men, women,
and children, were bedding themselves down in their, in many
instances, wretched abodes.&nbsp; As I wandered among them at
midnight hour I felt a cold chill of horror creeping over me, and
nightly dewdrops of sorrow forcing their way down my face.&nbsp;
To witness the sight I saw was enough to cause the blood to
freeze in any man&rsquo;s veins.&nbsp; One of the most hellish
sights upon earth is a dirty, drunken, swearing woman putting her
children to bed upon rags undressed and unwashed, and with a
flickering candle dying in the socket.&nbsp; Fathers and mothers,
sons and daughters all lying mixed together, numbering on an
average four, six, eight, ten, and twelve men, women, and
children, of all ages and sizes, in the space of a covered
waggon, is what ought never to be allowed in any civilized
country, much less Christian England, which spends millions in
trying to convert the Indian, civilize the savage, transform the
Chinaman, Christianize the African, and in preparing the world
for the millennium which is to follow the redeeming efforts of
Christ&rsquo;s followers.&nbsp; Oh! haste happy day, when
John&rsquo;s vision shall dawn upon us with all its never-ending
transcendent splendour, tenderness, and heavenly reality. <a
name="citation161"></a><a href="#footnote161"
class="citation">[161]</a></p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>&ldquo;And God shall wipe away all tears from their
eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor
crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former
things are passed away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not half a dozen of this thousand human beings would be
offering up an evening prayer other than that of hell.&nbsp; The
backsliding woman from Northampton and her son had crept for the
night under their stall.&nbsp; Of course she had said her
prayers, as she had told me, according to her wont, by the side
of their stall, or may be after she had <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>drawn their
tent covering round them for the night; at any rate I left them
to have one other peep at my friends the gipsies F&mdash; before
wending my way to my lodgings.&nbsp; On arriving at the van I saw
a flickering light in the windows.&nbsp; The top window was
nearly shut.&nbsp; The woman had had <i>a little too much</i>,
but not sufficient to drive her wild or out of her senses.&nbsp;
The husband had been &ldquo;cross&rdquo; with her.&nbsp; They had
finished their midnight meal.&nbsp; The poor little children were
almost &ldquo;dead sleepy,&rdquo; and for a minute or two all was
quiet, and then I heard the backsliding mother teaching the poor
sleepy children as they knelt down in the van to repeat,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bless Thy little lamb to-night,<br />
Through the darkness be Thou near me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep me safe till morning light.</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>&ldquo;Let my sins be all forgiven.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bless the friends I love so well,<br />
Take me when I die to heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy there with Thee to dwell.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For Jesus Christ&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They now fastened their van top door down and bade me
good-night.&nbsp; Their dog had snoozled under their home on
wheels.&nbsp; Fogs and chills were creeping round.&nbsp; The
policeman&rsquo;s tramp was to be heard, and with death-like
silence reigning I crept between the cold sheets to toss and
tumble about till the bright morning sun appeared, to fasten upon
my heart the sights of the previous day at the Oxford St.
Giles&rsquo;s fair, not to be removed till eternity dawns upon my
soul with heaven in full view.&nbsp; To, as Marianne Farningham
says in <i>The Christian World</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A land where noises of the earth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For evermore shall cease,<br />
Where the weary ones are resting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the calm of perfect peace.&rdquo;</p>

165</span>Rambles Among the Gipsies at Hinckley Fair.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Hinckley</span> September fair has for
many long years been regarded as one of the greatest
&ldquo;screw&rdquo; fairs in England, and as a place where many
gipsies annually gather together to follow their usual and
profitable occupation of horse-dealing.&nbsp; At this fair they
buy all the good-looking &ldquo;screws&rdquo; they can put their
hands upon, and palm and physic them off, temporarily, as sound
horses.&nbsp; They both, as one told me, &ldquo;make their
market&rdquo; and &ldquo;make hay while the sun shines&rdquo; at
this fair.&nbsp; A thorough old &ldquo;screw&rdquo; knows as if
by instinct the scent of gipsy pantaloons; and by some means,
known only to a few, the horses find their way back into gipsy
hands again.</p>
<p>With these facts before me, I was prompted to pay the gipsies
a visit at their Eldorado.&nbsp; The morning was like a spring
morning.&nbsp; The sun shone cheerfully, lovely, and warmingly,
and was fast drying up the mud.&nbsp; On my way to the station
some slovenly waggoner had left some thorns in the way, which I
threw over the fence and passed on.&nbsp; I had not gone far
before I found, on a rising hill, a large piece of granite in the
centre of the road, which some idle and careless Johnny had left
behind him.&nbsp; I <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>rolled it out of the way and sped
along.&nbsp; On the top of the hill a coal higgler had left a
large lump of coal in the way&mdash;or it had jolted off while he
was asleep, or akin to it.&nbsp; This I deposited among the
thistles and nettles in the ditch, where it remained for some
weeks.&nbsp; While I was clearing these little troublesome and
somewhat dangerous things out of the way, the skylark was singing
cheeringly and sweetly overhead as of spring-time.&nbsp; My gipsy
friends would say that these were forebodings and
prognostications, ruled by the planets, which indicated joys and
troubles, pleasure or sorrows for the travellers, according to
the amount of silver and gold there was floating about within
their reach.&nbsp; How I was guided by the Creator and the
planets, and with what success I pursued my course, will be seen
before I have done rambling.</p>
<p>At the station a poor woman was in a difficulty.&nbsp; She had
promised to have tea with her long-absent daughter, at the
&ldquo;feast&rdquo; at four o&rsquo;clock the same day; but,
unfortunately, the train would not take her to the
&ldquo;feast.&rdquo;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the remonstrances of
the porters, the good woman got into the train and said, &ldquo;I
shall go,&rdquo; and she sped her way, but not to the
&ldquo;feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A mother&rsquo;s love sees no difficulties and fears no
dangers, and will draw more tears from the human fountain than
any other force on this side heaven.</p>
<p>At Nuneaton there was the usual long time to wait; after which
I duly arrived at the &ldquo;screw fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the entrance there was gipsy &mdash; and his
wife&mdash;with their six lost little children, and the
probability of a seventh being soon added&mdash;setting up their
stall.</p>
<p>As I neared them, the poor woman met me and said, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what to do; I ought not to be here in this
market-place like this.&nbsp; I am liable to be down at any
minute, and I don&rsquo;t know one in the place.&nbsp; I wish our
Jim had settled down last spring.&nbsp; It is a hard lot to be a
<a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>gipsy&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; and she began to cry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nobody knows what I have had to put up with since I took
to travelling.&nbsp; Why, bless you, dear sir, it would make your
heart ache if I were to tell you a tenth part of what myself and
the children have gone through.&nbsp; Between Hilmorton and Ashby
St. Ledgers will never be forgotten by me.&nbsp; It was a cold
night, at the back end of the year; rain came down in
torrents.&nbsp; We had only an uncovered cart for all of us to
sleep in down one of the lanes.&nbsp; The children crouched under
the cart upon the ground like dogs.&nbsp; Our Jim, myself, and
three of the children slept, or lay down, in the body of the cart
with our dripping clothes on us.&nbsp; We drew an old torn
woollen rug over us, and did the best we could, shivering and
shaking till morning.&nbsp; The children cried, and were half
starved to death.&nbsp; I cannot tell you, if I went down upon my
knees, of a twentieth part of our sufferings and hardships on
that night, and hundreds of other nights besides.&nbsp; I had a
black eye, and was black and blue on many parts of my body.&nbsp;
Our Jim was very cruel at that time; but he has not been so bad
lately.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her husband, Jim, is about three parts a
gipsy, or between a <i>posh</i> and a Romany chal.&nbsp; He has
six children by his first wife, living with their grandmother
near Epping Forest, who are left to gipsy and take care of
themselves.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think that he would be a bad sort
of a man if it were not for &ldquo;drink&rdquo; and gipsy
companies.&nbsp; The only one who can read in this family is the
poor woman, and that is only very little.&nbsp; With tears in her
eyes she said, &ldquo;I often read the little books you gave me,
to our Jim at bedtime, till he cries, sometimes like a
baby.&nbsp; My heart is at times ready to break when I see how
our children are being brought up.&rdquo;&nbsp; Business was
beginning to look up with them, and I made myself scarce for a
time.&nbsp; Such sad, heartrending instances of gipsy neglect,
depravity, poverty, and wretchedness would be impossible <a

Government would carry out my plans for reclaiming them, and
Christians and philanthropists would do their duty towards
drawing them into the arms of the State and the fold of God.</p>
<p>I had not gone far before a terrible row was echoing in the
air from a stall lower down the market, between two gipsy women
and a &ldquo;potato master.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gipsy women said the
potato master had promised them three roasted potatoes for a
halfpenny, and he had only given them two.&nbsp; A fight,
hair-pulling, and bloodshed seemed to be in a fair way for being
the outcome of this trumpery dispute, and would have taken place
if the policeman had not put in an appearance.&nbsp; As it was
the fracas ended, for the present, in nothing worse than threats
of vengeance, oaths and curses being poured upon the head of the
potato seller without stint or measure.</p>
<p>I now turned into the horse fair, and had scarcely got many
yards before I found myself roughly jostled in the midst of a
gipsy row over a dog.&nbsp; The gipsy horse-dealer had a lurcher
dog with him, which was owned by a collier.&nbsp; The collier
said his dog had been stolen by some gipsies about two months
ago.&nbsp; High words, carrying mischief and blows, were flying
about thick and fast, and bade fair to end in bloodshed and the
pulling of the dog limb from limb.&nbsp; The dog preferred his
old master to the gipsy.&nbsp; This the gipsy saw, and at the
approach of the police the pair withdrew to a public-house to
&ldquo;square&rdquo; matters.&nbsp; In the end the collier came
out with his dog, which he said &ldquo;had won more handicaps
than any dog in the county,&rdquo; and off he started home, with
a smile instead of blood and bruises upon his face, and the dog
wagging its tail with delight at his heels, much to the chagrin
and discomfiture of the gipsy.</p>
<p>While I was among gipsy horse-dealers I made the best use of
my eyes for a little time, and one of the first <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>dodges of
the gipsies was to hire a country Johnny to ride one of their
&ldquo;screws&rdquo; up and down the fair.&nbsp; Of course the
gipsies kept clear away, hoping thereby to draw the attention of
customers to the horse as one that a farmer had no further use
for.&nbsp; Johnny had very nearly sold the horse to a higgler,
but &ldquo;at the last pinch&rdquo; the question of reducing the
amount Johnny was to sell it for, by one pound, necessitated an
appeal to the gipsy owner, who was not far away.&nbsp; The
higgler saw the dodge of the gipsy and he withdrew his
offer.&nbsp; The gipsy&rsquo;s blessing was given, but the
higgler did not mind it, and he went to seek other quarters for
horseflesh.</p>
<p>A little higher up the fair there stood a man with two horses,
who was evidently a small farmer in somewhat needy
circumstances.&nbsp; It might be, for anything I knew, that he
was wanting some money to pay for the cutting of his corn, which
was ripening very fast.&nbsp; The horses looked like two
thoroughly good sound horses, although aged.&nbsp; The price he
asked for the best-looking was &pound;25, and &pound;20 for the
other.&nbsp; The gipsies saw that this farmer was very anxious to
sell.&nbsp; A big, good-looking gipsy came up to him and said,
&ldquo;What for the big horse?&nbsp; Now, then, speak the lowest
price you will take for it in a word.&rdquo;&nbsp; The farmer
said, &ldquo;&pound;25.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said
the gipsy; &ldquo;you must think everybody is either a fool or
asleep.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give you a &lsquo;fiver&rsquo; for it,
and it is dear at that price.&rdquo;&nbsp; To one of his gipsy
mates he said, &ldquo;Jack, jump across it and ride it up the
fair.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jack jumped across the horse, and off they
started at a rattling pace, almost frightening people out of
their wits who were in the way.&nbsp; After going up and down a
few times several gipsies clustered round the horse when it and
its gipsy rider had cleared to outside the throng of the
fair.&nbsp; The group stood for a few minutes, and then the horse
was brought back and given up to the owner.&nbsp; The bargain was
not struck, and the <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>gipsies cleared away.&nbsp; In the
course of ten minutes the horse began to get very restless, kick,
and plunge about.&nbsp; Sometimes it seemed as if it wanted to
lie down.&nbsp; It would then begin to cringe and kick, much to
the danger of the lookers on.&nbsp; The owner said that a
horse-fly was on it somewhere.&nbsp; He stroked and tapped it,
but all to no purpose.&nbsp; Presently another gipsy came up,
evidently one of the gang, and said to the farmer, &ldquo;Why,
governor, your horse has either got the &lsquo;bellyache&rsquo;
or an inflammation; it will be dead in half an hour; what will
you take for it at all risks?&nbsp; Now, speak your lowest figure
at once.&rdquo;&nbsp; The farmer said, very much
&ldquo;chopfallen,&rdquo; &ldquo;A little time ago I asked
&pound;25, but I suppose I must take less than that
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gipsy saw his chance, and at once said,
&ldquo;I will give you a &lsquo;tenner,&rsquo; and not a farthing
more; say either &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no,&rsquo; and
I&rsquo;m off.&rdquo;&nbsp; The horse was still kicking
about.&nbsp; The farmer, much dejected, said, &ldquo;I suppose
you may as well have it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bargain was struck and
the kicking horse led away.&nbsp; In going up the fair a group of
gipsies clustered round it with evident glee.&nbsp; A few hours
afterwards I saw the horse led off quietly enough from Hinckley
fair at the heels of a gipsy.&nbsp; No doubt the horse had been
doctored by the gipsies in some way when they first took it in
hand and while it was surrounded by the first group.</p>
<p>In another instance a countryman bought a horse of a
&ldquo;farmer-looking&rdquo; gipsy and paid the money, when, just
before the horse was handed over to the purchaser, another gipsy
came upon the scene and claimed the horse as his own, and,
apparently, threatened vengeance and the gaol to be the doom of
the man who had sold the horse.&nbsp; The two gipsies now began
to pull each other about&mdash;without any bones being broken or
blood flowing&mdash;and to wrestle and struggle for the
possession of the horse.&nbsp; The country man had parted with
his money and he had not got the horse, nor any prospect of
it.&nbsp; Another gipsy came up and <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>suggested that the whole business
should be ended by the countryman having his money back except
ten shillings and the payment of &ldquo;glasses
round.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this arrangement the countryman assented,
and they turned into the public-house to carry out the
bargain.&nbsp; What sharp men and fools there are in the world,
to be sure, to be met with on gipsy fair ground!</p>
<p>As usual there were gipsy Smiths in the fair, and without much
difficulty I ran against one who was the proprietor of a popgun
establishment and two shillings&rsquo; worth of
&ldquo;toffy&rdquo; stuck round a wheel of fortune.&nbsp; I had a
long chat with him between the &ldquo;cracks,&rdquo; and elicited
the fact that he had twice tried gipsying in Ireland, but it
resulted each time in a drawn game.&nbsp; He only visited four
fairs.&nbsp; Irish soil and poverty are not suited for the
development of gipsying.&nbsp; The fact is, Irishmen are too wide
awake for the vagabond gipsies, and they are too much taken up
with the matter-of-fact everyday life to listen to idle lying,
misleading, romantic, wheedling tales designed to draw the money
out of their pockets.&nbsp; At one of the fairs in Ireland my
gipsy friend took four shillings, with a prospect of losing his
tent, bag and baggage.&nbsp; If he had been one of Arabi&rsquo;s
Egyptian ragamuffin soldiers frightened from Tel-el-Kebir he
could not have decamped more quickly from the land of St.
Patrick.&nbsp; The pleasure fairs of England and the fashionable
squares of London, and the watering-places on the coasts are
places and palaces where gipsy <i>kings</i> and <i>queens</i>
thrive best.</p>
<p>They fatten and thrive fairly well in some places in
Scotland.&nbsp; One cannot but smile sometimes at the ease with
which some of them go through the world.&nbsp; If their
cleverness was turned into legitimate channels and honourable
business transactions, they would soon be a credit to themselves
and to us as a nation.&nbsp; It is a thousand pities that in
these educational days there are <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>narrow-minded croakers who, under
the guise of friends&mdash;though in reality their worst
enemies&mdash;are trying to keep the gipsy children in ignorance;
but their object is easily seen by those who stand by and are
looking quietly and thoughtfully on.&nbsp; These false friends
smile in gipsy faces while they are robbing them of their lore to
fill their empty coffers, and this the gipsies will see some
day.</p>
<p>Gipsy Smith and myself began to enumerate all the vans in the
fair, together with those living in them.&nbsp; There were about
thirty gipsy vans, shows, covered carts, &amp;c.&nbsp; In one of
the vans there were eight children besides adults.&nbsp; In
another van there were seven children besides adults.&nbsp;
Altogether we counted over one hundred travelling children in the
fair, not three of whom could read and write.&nbsp; Smith said
that in all his travelling experience he had not known either
gipsy, showman, auctioneer, or traveller ever attend a place of
worship from fair grounds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sundays as a rule,&rdquo;
said Smith, &ldquo;are spent in travelling with their families
from town to town and from place to place.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gipsy
Smith lived and travelled with his wife in a covered
pony-cart.&nbsp; There were four &ldquo;Aunt Sally&rdquo; stalls,
which dealt out cigars to children for successful
&ldquo;throws.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gipsies are to-day doing more to
encourage gambling and smoking than is imagined by ninety-nine
out of every hundred Englishmen.&nbsp; The former saps the morals
and the latter the minds and constitutions of those who are
simple enough to indulge in them.</p>
<p>Before I had done talking with gipsy Smith the Salvation Army
brass band from Leicester, with &ldquo;Captain&rdquo; Roberts
from the headquarters, one of the staff officers, hailed within
sight and sound, and as I had not had the opportunity to spend an
evening with the Salvation Army, to see and hear for myself
something of the proceedings, I joined in the procession as an
outsider.&nbsp; Some of the people made an eye-butt of me at
which they stared.&nbsp; Crowds <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>were gathering round the band as it
played in martial strains&mdash;if Mr. Inspector Denning had been
there from the House of Commons better order could not have been
kept&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hark! hark! my soul, what warlike songs are
swelling<br />
Through all the streets and on from door to door;<br />
How grand the truths these burning strains are telling<br />
Of that great war till sin shall be no more.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the vocal band with their voices would join in
singing the choruses with exciting strains and gesture&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Salvation Army, Army of God,<br />
Onward to conquer the world with fire and blood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this the brass band led the next verse&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Onward we go, the world shall hear our
singing,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After they had played this up the street for a time, the Army
halted, and Captain Roberts and one of the lieutenants addressed
some words to the &ldquo;band&rdquo; with fire and vigour running
through them, to which the lads and lasses, young men and
maidens, saints and sinners, responded with the &ldquo;Old
Methodist&rdquo; and Primitive Methodist &ldquo;Glory! glory!
bless the Lord!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; &ldquo;Religion
is the best thing in the world!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Glory!&rdquo;
another called out at the top of his voice.&nbsp; While the Army
was giving out no uncertain sound the brass band commenced, under
marching orders and exciting surroundings, reminding me of old
times&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are marching home to glory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Marching up to mansions bright,<br />
Where bright golden harps are playing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the saints are robed in white.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then, in obedience to the captain&rsquo;s arms and orders,
the lads and lasses struck up with the chorus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a golden harp in glory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a spotless robe for you&mdash;<br />
March with us to the hallelujah city,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the land beyond the blue.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>And
in this way we kept on till we arrived at the &ldquo;Salvation
Warhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A drunken man dressed in rags, but with an intelligent-looking
face and a high forehead, must of needs have a word to say, and
for a time a &ldquo;branglement&rdquo; seemed inevitable.&nbsp;
However, with a little tact the storm blew over.&nbsp; After a
little work at &ldquo;knee drill&rdquo; in the warhouse the Army
rested for a short time to recruit their animal strength.&nbsp;
While this was going on I looked out for a couch upon which to
rest my bones for the night, and this I found out at Mr.
Atkins&rsquo;, in the market-place.&nbsp; I then retired to get
my dinner and tea in a coffee-tavern, of pork pie and coffee,
among &ldquo;chaps and their girls&rdquo; who had come to
Hinckley for a &ldquo;fairing.&rdquo;&nbsp; From thence I
strolled to some gipsy vans on the green, to find a number of the
women washing clothes.&nbsp; My reception was in anything but
heavenly language.&nbsp; The gipsies at this fair were from
Staffordshire, nearly all of whom were unknown to me.&nbsp; If
two of the women had wanted to impress a stranger with the idea
that they were of the poor unfortunate gutter-scum class, they
could not have used more disgusting language than they did.&nbsp;
I chatted with them and gave the children some books and pennies,
which brought sorrow from the lips of the gipsy parents for
having insulted me.&nbsp; After strolling about among the gipsies
and vans in the fair for a time, and distributing some cards and
picture-books among the gipsy, show, and other travelling
children, I wended my way, guided by the sound of &ldquo;the
light and leading&rdquo; of the Salvation band, to the
&ldquo;Salvation shop,&rdquo; to spend a happy hour or two.&nbsp;
I sat in one corner and looked quietly on, which seemed to puzzle
them.&nbsp; The leaders all had a good stare at me; and first one
and then the other would try to draw me out with the usual
question, to which I replied very politely and left them in a
maze.&nbsp; Captain Roberts <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>told me over breakfast on the Sunday
morning that I had been a puzzle to the &ldquo;band&rdquo; all
the previous evening; and, except to &ldquo;Captain
Roberts&rdquo; and the good family with whom I was staying, I
still remain so, for aught I know.</p>
<p>The Army had commenced proceedings, and at the word of command
began to &ldquo;fire red-hot shot at the devil.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was a lively, exciting time.&nbsp; The band struck up while they
were sitting down&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My rest is in heaven, my rest is not
here,<br />
Then why should I murmur when trials are near?<br />
Be hushed, my dark spirit, the worst that can come<br />
But shortens my journey and hastens me home.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this the &ldquo;command&rdquo; was for
&ldquo;knee-drill.&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly some of the language
and action of the soldiers was a little out of the
&ldquo;Friends&rsquo;&rdquo; style of doing things.&nbsp; One
soldier shouted out at the top of his voice, with a large amount
of enthusiasm, &ldquo;Lord, help us to kill the devil, he has
troubled us long enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another would call out,
&ldquo;Lord, the devil has got some powder in his breast; light
it with a match and blow his head off;&rdquo; to which another
soldier would reply, &ldquo;Give the devil string enough and he
will hang himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Glory!&rdquo; they all
shouted.</p>
<p>They now got off their knees, and big and little began to
relate their experiences, and to &ldquo;tell what the Lord had
done for them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our &ldquo;good brother&rdquo; in his
experiences said, &ldquo;While I was serving the devil, he made a
sign-post of me for a rogue&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; Now I am a member
of the Salvation Army, with a bit of blue in my coat, which is
better than having red on the end of your nose.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thank God, it is good, brother; hallelujah!&rdquo; shouted
a number of volunteers.</p>
<p>One little boy said, in his experience with moistened cheeks,
&ldquo;Thank the Lord; before I joined the Salvation <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>Army I was
a bad boy; but now I say my prayers, and am trying to be good,
and mean to get to heaven!&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One little girl, with tears in her eyes, said, &ldquo;Before I
joined the Salvation Army I used to be a naughty, bad girl; now I
am praying to God, and try to be good.&nbsp; O Lord, do save my
poor mother, and my brothers and sisters, for Jesus
Christ&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;&nbsp; A number of girls
and boys related their experiences in similar strains.&nbsp; One
grey-headed old man, with wet eyes and trembling emotion, thanked
&ldquo;God that He had put it into the mind of one of the boys in
the room to leave him a tract, and to invite him to join the
Salvation Army.&nbsp; It was the best thing that had ever been
done to him.&nbsp; Instead of serving the devil, who was a bad
master, he was serving God, and hoped to get to heaven.&nbsp;
Bless God, and the lads and lasses.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain now called on the &ldquo;band&rdquo; to strike up
one of their &ldquo;marches,&rdquo; which they did:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is a better world, they say, oh so
bright!<br />
Where sin and woe are done away, oh so bright!<br />
And music fills the balmy air,<br />
And Angels with bright wings are there,<br />
And harps of gold, and mansions fair, oh so bright!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Lion of Judah shall break my chain,<br
/>
And give us the victory again and again,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then wended my way to my lodging at Mr. Atkins&rsquo;, all
the better for having spent a couple of hours with the
&ldquo;Salvation Army;&rdquo; and with good wishes for its
success, I dozed away, with a &ldquo;captain&rdquo; of the
Salvation Army for a neighbour on one side, and a clergyman of
the Church of England on the other, feeling sure that between
these two good Christian centurion brothers, and under the eye of
my Master, I was pretty sure to land safely, after the tossings
of the night, at the breakfast table in <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>the
morning.&nbsp; During my midnight wandering in mist and
dreamland, the following aphorisms, thoughts, and suggestions
floated before my brain.</p>
<p>As the beautiful colours of the field, forest, dell, garden,
and bower are produced by the rays of the sun, so are the
beautiful traits of Christian life produced by the rays of Divine
love, as exemplified and manifested by the Son of God, our
blessed Lord.</p>
<p>The nation that allows her children of tender years to drift
about at sea without rescuing them from ruin, has decay, or
&ldquo;dry rot,&rdquo; at work among her timbers, and will before
long become a wreck.</p>
<p>The country that cannot find time to see to the interest of
its little children within its borders, has allowed the devil to
throw dust into the eyes of its leaders, to blind them against
its happiness and prosperity by leading all into the dark.</p>
<p>Why are some Christians little-loved, weak-kneed, and
sickly?&nbsp; Because they, like babies, live on
&ldquo;sop&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, trashy fiction, shows,
sights, sounds, and unrealities, instead of the love of God and
the pure milk of His word.</p>
<p>When you see a Christian with the love of God burning deadly
within his soul, and without either light or heat being the
outcome, it may be taken for granted that a lot of worldly ashes
are in the way choking up the ventilation and air passages; and
if he will not set to work at once to clear out the ashes and
dust of sin God will do it for him, either by the chastening rod
of affliction or losses and crosses in other forms.</p>
<p>Cloaks of deception and fraud are made out of the fibres of
disease and putrefaction, and those who wear them are exposed to
the disgust and loathing of all upright observers.</p>
<p>Cloaks of honesty and uprightness are made out of the fibres
of love and truthfulness, and the wearers of them <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>are
received with the smiles and loving embraces of all classes of
society.</p>
<p>When you see a Christian without either life or soul within
him, you may rest satisfied that bank-notes, musty-fusty deeds,
or other things upon which he has set his affections, are
clinging round and coming across the ventricles of his heart, and
unless removed they will cause death both to the body and to the
soul.&nbsp; If the earth-bound Christian will set fire to them by
exposing them and his heart to a ray of Divine love, he will be
able to jump over a mountain and scale the battlements of heaven,
and with flag in hand shout, &ldquo;Victory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some dashing, flashing wicked men are like a balloon without a
vent-hole filled with the devil&rsquo;s gas, which expands the
higher it rises; and for a time they float upon the surface of
humanity, finally seeking pleasure among the clouds of
fascination and frivolity; and in this region they burst and come
down to earth and their senses with a tremendous crash, to find
when it is too late that they have been making fools of
themselves, and that their grappling irons will not save them
from oblivion and ruin.</p>
<p>A clever, wise, thoughtful, sagacious, and Christian statesman
may be compared to an aeronaut, who sits in his balloon-car
carried by public opinion and pulling the strings of popular
applause.&nbsp; Popular applause is the gas by which a statesman
floats in the air above his followers; the cords and netting that
hold the bottom together are his friends; the treasury bench is
his car and the press his strings, which, wisely handled, enable
him to land upon the desired spot.&nbsp; Poor wayward and
wrong-doing relations are the grappling irons that hold him to
the earth; hangers are paupers, and loafers are his
sandbags.&nbsp; Infidels, Fenians, Sceptics, and Communists are
matches, fusees, and percussion caps, thrown into his car by
disappointed <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>office-seekers and courtiers with the object of sending
him to Jamaica before his work is done.&nbsp; When those various
elements have either been thrown out of the car, stamped out, or
brought under proper control, he will then mount higher and
higher till he finally quits his car and finds himself seated by
the throne of God.</p>
<p>The best stimulating food for an overworked brain, and
containing more phosphorus than a thousand fish, is the essence
of Divine love, and grace and truth in equal quantities, to be
taken upon the knees as often as circumstances need.&nbsp; Before
applying to the Great Physician for this medicine the patient
should spend an hour in meditation and solitude.</p>
<p>When you see professing Christian parents setting their
children to ferret into other people&rsquo;s affairs, it is a
sure sign that they are fonder of rat-catching than filling their
souls with good things; and the unwary should be on the look-out,
or they will be trapped by these godly rat-catchers and their
skins taken to be made into purses.</p>
<p>The various denominations of Christian churches in the country
may be likened to an orchard of apple trees, most of which are
bearing fruit in one form or other.&nbsp; Some are just beginning
to bear fruit, and there are others dead or dying, while there
are some trees producing larger quantities of ripe, healthy
fruit.&nbsp; In some cities, towns, and villages the best kinds
of fruit are to be seen, and in other places the little hard sour
crabs, which almost set one&rsquo;s teeth on edge to look at
them, much less to taste.&nbsp; The best and largest fruit in any
case is that which grows upon the most healthy trees and
branches, exposed to the sun&rsquo;s rays, and draws its
nourishment the most direct from the parent trunk.&nbsp; Fruit
upon almost dead branches does not so soon get ripe as the fruit
upon healthy branches, and it is small and shrivelled up.&nbsp;
In some localities we shall see what we may call
&ldquo;Blenheim&rdquo; <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>churches, &ldquo;Russett&rdquo;
churches, &ldquo;Crab&rdquo; churches, &ldquo;Keswick&rdquo;
churches, &ldquo;Northern Green&rdquo; churches, &ldquo;Whiting
Pippin&rdquo; churches, &ldquo;Winter&rdquo; churches, &amp;c.,
growing side by side.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Crab&rdquo; church is
little, hard, and sour; the &ldquo;Blenheim&rdquo; church is
rich, large, delicious, and healthy; the &ldquo;Russett&rdquo;
church is uninviting, but juicy, and much better than it
looks.&nbsp; So in like manner with other kinds of Christian
churches.&nbsp; The name of the churches answering under these
various names must be answered by the members themselves.&nbsp;
As digging, dunging, pruning, and grafting improves the trees and
the quality of the fruit, so in like manner our heavenly Father
has to deal with His churches, or they would all die
together.&nbsp; Conscience, surrounded with death-like stillness,
asks the question, &ldquo;To which do you belong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man who has forsaken the path God has marked out for him has
stuffed his ears with wool, and jumped upon the devil&rsquo;s
steam tug, and is being taken into a long, dark, dark tunnel,
with no light at the other end; and the light of heaven and the
gospel which he has left behind him are, through distance, smoke,
and steam, and his own bad actions, getting gradually less.&nbsp;
The only light he can see, and which will not help him to grope
his way in his wretched condition, is derived from farthing
rush-lights called science, made and placed in the dark watery
cavern by men&rsquo;s hands; and these get fewer as he is being
pulled along by evil influences, until he is lost in despair,
with horror upon his face and wringing his hands in grief he
passes away.</p>
<p>As children sitting upon a swing gate rocking to and fro are
in some degree being prepared for the storms of a life at sea, so
are the little foretastes of heavenly pleasure enjoyed by His
children from time to time, filling, preparing, and nerving them
for the tempestuous ocean which awaits them.</p>
<p><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>People without gratitude for God&rsquo;s mercies may be
compared to swine eating chestnuts as they fall from the
trees.&nbsp; Their refined senses are only manifested in grunts
and grumbles.&nbsp; Wise are the people who take lessons from the
little birds, and sing God&rsquo;s praises while they enjoy His
blessings.</p>
<p>Gamblers are the devil&rsquo;s cats set by his Satanic majesty
to catch children and fools, and woe be to those who are caught
within their clutches.</p>
<p>Those who cling to forms and ceremonies entirely as a means of
getting to heaven, will have their eyes opened some day to find
out that they are hugging and fondling an illegitimate child of a
parent of a very questionable character.&nbsp; The more they know
of the child they have been fondling and its mother, the more
they will be disgusted with themselves at having been such dupes
and fools.</p>
<p>Those who disobey their parents will find that they are
putting a noose round their necks, and tying the other end of the
rope to a gate post; and when they have done this the words
&ldquo;love&rdquo; and &ldquo;duty&rdquo; in letters of fire will
spring up as from the ground, which will keep getting larger and
hotter until the wrong-doers are strangled.</p>
<p>The devil&rsquo;s butterfly is an unconverted clergyman, who
gets upon the back of a horse to gallop a fox to death on the
week day, dresses in fantastical colours on Sundays, dances
before his congregation with incense in his hands, and with his
face towards the east, tries to carry his congregation on his
wings to a place he knows not where; hypocritically singing the
<i>Te Deum</i> in Latin as they go from &ldquo;pillar to
post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those landlords who object to the cultivation of their waste
lands for food for man and beast will find that the scent of the
gorse, perfume of the heather, contains the fragrance of the
bankruptcy court, with the hares, rabbits, <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>partridges,
pheasants, woodcock and snipe flapping about the doors uttering
horrible noises for their folly.&nbsp; The horrors of the court
will be increased by hearing the cries of the children asking for
bread with none to give.</p>
<p>Those people who, with the aid of a glib tongue, cunning, and
deception, are weaving a cloak of soft words to cover a mass of
iniquity, will find out too late, unless very careful, that the
mass of corruption they have been hiding will burst out with a
more horrible stench than that of a dead corpse.</p>
<p>Infidels and sceptics who rest entirely upon science and
nature as a lever by which they hope to lift humanity into
paradise, have only to look into a bright black earthenware
teapot to discover what sort of wry and contortious faces they
are pulling before the public.</p>
<p>The most powerful magnet in the world is the love of
God.&nbsp; It can draw the sting of the devil, disarm enemies,
and lift all the human beings in the universe into heaven.&nbsp;
The more it is used the stronger and more powerful it gets.</p>
<p>Sceptics and infidels, seeking for the so-called errors in the
Divine Word, may be compared to blind and foot-tied weasels,
trying to catch &ldquo;Jack Sharps&rdquo; in a broad, deep, clear
stream of pure water.&nbsp; They leave their sickening scent on
their trail behind them, to be carried forward to be lost in the
great stream of truth from whence all our blessings flow.</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s gifts to children produce more blessed,
lasting, and Christ-like results than any other gifts in the
universe.&nbsp; Children&rsquo;s gifts to poor little outcast,
forgotten, and neglected children are seeds of kindness that will
live as long as this world endures, and they will then bloom in
Paradise for ever.</p>
<p>Christians who receive their strength for the conflicts and
trials of life from reading light books while sitting in
drawing-room slippers, and under the sound of frothy <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>conversation, instead of from closet prayer and faith,
and the rain and sunshine of heaven, are like window plants,
which derive their strength from cold and poisonous water put to
their roots.&nbsp; Plants, whether in nature or grace, grown
under such circumstances soon become unhealthy and drooping, and
unable to stand the bare breath of opposition.</p>
<p>Christians living upon the church roll in name only, without
the cheering and enlivening influence of the Holy Spirit, will
become like plants grown in a dark room, pale and feeble.&nbsp;
Some Christian lives are weeds, and may be known by their
crotchets, tempers, and wrinkles.</p>
<p>The first signs of a withering church may be said to have
manifested themselves when the living members extend the dead
hand of sympathy to the suffering members of their own flock.</p>
<p>With the seeds of life are the seeds of death, and at the
birth of any child the mortal conflict begins, never to result in
a &ldquo;drawn game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Christians, like big plants, require more water than small
ones; and so in like manner Christians who have many cares,
troubles, business and state responsibility require more grace
than little Christians, and those who have it not will soon
become bankrupt.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;will&rdquo; and &ldquo;principle&rdquo; are
man&rsquo;s own twin-sisters, the offspring of life, and run side
by side through the marrow of man&rsquo;s nature; and who derive
their vitality, life, and power from the unseen spiritual
influences by which they are surrounded for good or for evil; and
every action that tends to cripple either the one or deform the
other is soon manifested in the crooked actions of a man&rsquo;s
life, shaping immortality.</p>
<p>Crooked Christians, like crooked trees, are neither so
profitable nor beautiful to behold as those who grow straight and
stately.</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>Under
the guise of an angel of light, Satan dangles false hope before
some Christians, as a basket made of finely-wrought and tender
twigs, a bouquet of delicate, beautiful, lovely, and richly
scented greenhouse plants, as a foretaste of what is before, or
in reserve for those who follow his advice&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the
influence of the ball-room, theatre, gay living, high life,
fashion, and fancy, &amp;c.; and so dexterously does the arch
enemy hold these things before the simple ones, or entwine them
round their hearts, that they are ready to cry out,
&ldquo;hell&rdquo; is heaven and &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; is hell;
and in this way the simple are groping after shadows till they
find themselves surrounded by a darkness blacker than midnight,
and without a friend in the world, with the devil laughing in
their face for having been such fools.</p>
<p>The best antidote against beer and hellish swears is cold
water and upward prayers.</p>
<p>To a troubled conscience, at midnight hour the ticking of a
clock sounds as loud as the death knell of the church bell.</p>
<p>Every act of good or ill we perform makes an indent upon the
coil of future life, which will speak and re-speak to us through
the never-ending ages of eternity as they roll along.</p>
<p>Every time a Christian looks at sin with a longing eye, the
devil draws a thin beautiful tinted film before his eyes, through
which film, in process of time, the fire in his conscience eye,
kindled at the time of his conversion, is unable to penetrate, or
see the dangers lying across his path.</p>
<p>Tears of penitence, joy, and gladness are the best eye-salve
for those whose eyes are growing dim.</p>
<p>Christians who have to live in and wade through the mud of
slander and lying pools of deceit have need to wear watertight
boots, of the kind described in the good old book.</p>
<p>By listening attentively to the prayers of a Christian, <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>you will
soon discover whether he wants&mdash;like a run-down
clock&mdash;winding up.&nbsp; Losses and crosses, the death of a
darling child, affliction, and a thousand other things, God useth
as He seemeth well to wind him up and set him a-going again with
fresh vigour.</p>
<p>A man who has a heart full of prejudice, spite, malice, and
envy has an extra eye upon his nose, eclipsing his other eyes,
which can both smell and see the dark side of a man&rsquo;s
character.&nbsp; So sensitive is this nose-eye that it can detect
faults and failings when there are none to be detected.</p>
<p>The most lovely Christians are those who, like the beautiful
butterfly and charming songsters, live in the sunlight of His
throne.</p>
<p>The more miserable Christians are those who, like bats, buzz
about in the dark.</p>
<p>Some Christians are like London dogs galloping about the
streets after froth, losing their masters, and then they howl
out, &ldquo;Oh that I knew where I might find him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the benevolent action of drawing-room philanthropy ends
in nothing but tall talk and carpet gossip, it may be compared to
soap bubbles piped forth for show.</p>
<p>Youths receiving their habits, nourishment, character, and
stamina from the pothouse and gin-palace may be compared to
plants grown in a room lighted and warmed with gas, which sicken
and die.</p>
<p>Artificial Christians are like wax flowers, pretty to look
upon; but without scent and perfume, difficult to handle, and
they will not stand the fire.</p>
<p>Society is like a book of poems, and those members with the
most sentiment, poetry, or sympathy in their natures will be the
most sought after, prized, and used.</p>
<p>To a man who has done wrong, and has a troubled conscience, a
louse upon the window pane appears as an ugly monster.</p>
<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>Conscience is the soul&rsquo;s looking-glass, and
blessed is the man who has courage to hold it up to behold what
manner of man he is.</p>
<p>A sick room is often God&rsquo;s pinfold, where He places in
naughty wandering children; and there they will lie until either
our blessed Saviour unlocks the gate or takes them over the top
of the walls to heaven.</p>
<p>Authors and their books are like flowers: some are small, but
send out a rich fragrance, and may be used as button-holes in the
drawing-room; others are lovely to look upon, but as sour as
crabs to handle and taste.&nbsp; There are others as large and
showy as the sunflower, with a perfume anything but paradisical;
and there are others with heavenly virtues running through
themselves and their books to such an extent that a child will
have no difficulty in gathering sufficient flowers to form a
beautiful bouquet; and not a few in this our day are actually
poisonous, and dangerous to meddle with.</p>
<p>Strong conviction, the offspring of thought and reflection, is
the handmaid of inspiration, and the agent through which this
heavenly soul-impelling power works out the Divine ends and
decrees of Providence in carrying on the affairs of the world;
and those who are heavenly inspired by means of the golden cord
of love and sympathy, in full action between themselves and God,
may be said to be His cabinet ministers.</p>
<p>The food eaten by an idle man warps his body, stunts his mind,
and sends his soul to ruin.</p>
<p>An oak tree, or any other tree which stands the storms with
defiance, are those whose roots have hold of mother earth with
the firmest grip; and as in nature so in grace.&nbsp; A man to
withstand all the storms of life must have firm hold upon the
Deity.</p>
<p>A crooked tree may be said to be faulty; and it is neither so
valuable nor beautiful as those that are <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>straight
and stately; so in like manner it may be said of the crooked
members of Christian churches and social societies.</p>
<p>Some members of the community may he properly called
&ldquo;creepers,&rdquo; for they very much resemble the
ivy.&nbsp; They have neither backbone nor principle.&nbsp; Their
object is to creep into religious communities and social
societies, so as to entwine themselves round the members.&nbsp;
They harbour filth, impede growth, hide beauty, and climb by the
strength they steal from others.</p>
<p>A church whose members are tipsters may be compared to a marsh
with too much water at the roots, bringing forth rushes, sedges,
and buttercups.</p>
<p>Upon the tail of a snail a farmer&rsquo;s weather glass is to
be seen; so in like manner the footsteps of an enemy will reveal
to an observing mind the dangers to be avoided.</p>
<p>Some Christian ministers are like the gas stove, warm-looking
in the pulpit, but cold at home.</p>
<p>A man with all sorts of wrong ideas, crotchets, and queer
notions in his head exhibits himself as a marsh with spots of
green grass and daisies, to get at which mud and quagmire will
have to be faced and got through before they are reached, and
when this has been done the trouble will have been wasted.</p>
<p>Selfish men and misers engaged in grubbing after mammon may be
compared to a swarm of flies feeding upon a dung-heap; and so
long as the sun of prosperity shines they can feed, buzz, annoy,
and sting.</p>
<p>A man who kisses his wife to hide his sins is sowing seeds
that will produce a crop of anguish and despair that will hang
heavier round his neck than a millstone.&nbsp; A kissing deceiver
is the devil&rsquo;s major-general.</p>
<p>Every time a man or woman does a deceitful action they make
and deposit a grain of gunpowder, that only requires the light of
public opinion and truth to send the <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>maker, according to the number of
grains deposited, into eternity to reap his folly.</p>
<p>Hungry-bellied politicians, whose object is to sting in order
to feed, are the gadflies of English society, settling upon John
Bull to fill their pockets and rob for fame.</p>
<p>Paupers and lawyers are leeches which fasten upon social life,
often sucking the blood of those who are the least able to stand
them.</p>
<p>A wife who cooks her husband&rsquo;s meals five minutes behind
time is carving furrows upon his forehead.</p>
<p>A mother who sends her children unwashed to school is
embedding in the child&rsquo;s nature seeds that will one day
bring a crop of poverty, wretchedness, and despair.</p>
<p>A man who sits playing with his thumbs, hoping that something
will turn up to put him upon the pedestal of fame and fortune, is
hatching addled eggs, and the longer he sits upon them the worse
they will stink.</p>
<p>Infidelity is a thick, muddy canal made by men&rsquo;s hands,
the bosom of which is covered with the weeds of idiosyncrasies
and Satanic doubts; and beneath its surface it teems with all
kinds of big and little, prickly, dead, and dying venomous
reptiles; and woe be to the man who trusts his barque upon its
stinking and putrefying surface with the hope that it will carry
him to the crystal river and sea of glass.</p>
<p>Something of the wonderful infinitude, love, and power of God,
in regulating and governing the external and internal relation of
myriads upon myriads of millions of worlds teeming with life,
variety, and beauty, may be gathered if we can grasp the idea
that the separate particles of the rays of light sent forth by
the sun to illumine our world each morning are, after they have
done their work, whirled into unknown and unbounded space, and
transformed as they fly, at a rate faster than imagination can
travel, into suns to light up other worlds and other <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>systems.&nbsp; And yet He finds time to number the
hairs upon our heads; yea, a sparrow cannot fall to the ground
without His notice.&nbsp; Wonderful! most wonderful!&nbsp; Past
comprehension.&nbsp; None can fathom.</p>
<p>As the twelve precious stones&mdash;jasper, sapphire,
chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolyte, beryl, topaz,
chrysoprasus, jacinth, and an amethyst formed the foundation of
the heavenly Jerusalem, the future home of His saints, with
pearly gates, as seen by John the divine in apostolic days; so do
hopeful, believing, fighting, wrestling, joyous, singing,
patient, benevolent, praying, working, and conquering Christians
form the foundation of the present-day heavenly temple, with love
and concord as doors, and walls of virtue, wherein God delights
to dwell among His children, witnessing adoration with loving
eyes, and listening to hymns of praise and thanksgiving with
melodious ears.</p>
<p>A man may be said to be in a fog when he cannot see the hand
of Providence in all his dealings, or God&rsquo;s finger pointing
out his way.</p>
<p>A closet is a burrow into which a Christian who is hounded to
death by the dogs of hell can run and be safe.&nbsp; When once
there, Christians can smile at their howls and sing while they
show their teeth with rage.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock I was unbolting the door, making my way
out of the house to a number of gipsy vans in an orchard on the
outskirts of the town.&nbsp; On going to the place I met a little
<i>posh</i> gipsy dressed in &ldquo;rags and trashes,&rdquo; with
the heels&mdash;what was left of the
&ldquo;trashes&rdquo;&mdash;upside down.&nbsp; He had just turned
out of his bed, he said, and from his bed followed the dog, both
having snoozled under the van&mdash;in which his uncle and aunt
lay&mdash;on the ground, with a wet, damp rug as a
covering.&nbsp; &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said the little <i>posh</i>
gipsy boy, &ldquo;can you tell me where I <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>can get a
bottle of ginger beer?&nbsp; I am so thirsty and hungry.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve had nothing since my dinner yesterday.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
went with the boy to several houses where &ldquo;Ginger-beer sold
here&rdquo; was displayed in the window, but without
success.&nbsp; I gave the boy the price of a bottle and trotted
him off lower down the town to quench his thirst and satisfy his
appetite.</p>
<p>The gipsies were just beginning to &ldquo;turn out,&rdquo; and
the little gipsies, half naked, were hunting up sticks out of the
hedge-bottom to light the fire to boil the water for
breakfast.&nbsp; The men and dogs were collecting together in
groups, half-dressed, to relate to each other their successes at
the fair.&nbsp; Apart from the rest of the gipsies, owning a van
of a better kind than the others, two old gipsies were enjoying
their breakfast upon the ground.&nbsp; As soon as the old gipsy
woman&mdash;whose face betokened that it had figured in many an
encounter, and was somewhat highly coloured&mdash;saw me, she
began to get excited, and called me to them.&nbsp; I thought,
&ldquo;Now is the time for squalls; look out.&rdquo;&nbsp; I drew
near to the old woman with a strange mixture of feelings.&nbsp;
It was early in the morning.&nbsp; There were now about a score
of gipsy men and women looking on, and a few of the dogs came
sniffing at my heels.&nbsp; I tried to screw a smile upon my
face, and to dig and delve low for a pleasant joke, but it would
not come from the &ldquo;vasty deep.&rdquo;&nbsp; On my approach
the old woman jumped up from the ground, and with both hands
clasped mine in hers, which felt as rough as a navvy&rsquo;s,
saying while griping them tightly, &ldquo;Bless yer, my good mon,
I&rsquo;ve wanted to see yer for a long while.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
long &rsquo;erd abaut yer, and ha&rsquo; never had th&rsquo;
pleasure o&rsquo; puttin&rsquo; my een on yer till this
mornin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Sit yer down on th&rsquo; gress, I want to
tawke to yer.&nbsp; Dunner yer be freetened, I&rsquo;m not
goin&rsquo; to swaller yer, bless yer, master mon.&nbsp;
Yer&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; sum brekust, wonner yer?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I did not <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although I did not exactly like the
appearance of things, I thought it would not do to say
&ldquo;no,&rdquo; and I knelt upon the damp grass.&nbsp; In a pan
over their fiery embers were the remnants of bacon and red
herrings.&nbsp; There was only one large cup and saucer, without
a handle, for the pair of them.&nbsp; I thought most surely she
would fetch a cup and saucer out of the van for me.&nbsp; Such
was not to be the case.&nbsp; A group of some ten or twelve
working men of Hinckley stood looking over the hedge only a few
yards away, at the old woman&rsquo;s &ldquo;megrims.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She handed me in the first place a piece of bread, upon which was
some bacon and herring.&nbsp; It took me all the time to swallow
this uninviting morsel.&nbsp; I munched a little of it, and some
I put into my pocket for another time.&nbsp; She now filled up
her cup with tea, and made her fingers do duty for sugar
tongs.&nbsp; I could see no teaspoons about, except one that was
among the herrings and bacon.&nbsp; This was fetched out and
plunged into the tea, and round and round it went, leaving upon
the top of the dark-coloured tea&mdash;which I could now see by
the bright morning sun shining upon the scene&mdash;stars
floating about.&nbsp; The old woman first drank herself, and then
handed the cup of tea to me.&nbsp; I supped and nibbled the
crust.&nbsp; I supped again, till between us the cup was nearly
emptied.&nbsp; She had a strong scent of &ldquo;Black
Jack,&rdquo; and I kept a very sharp eye upon what parts of the
cup the old woman drank from.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now then to
bisness,&rdquo; said the old gipsy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yer see none
o&rsquo; we gipsies con read an&rsquo; write.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
show yer I con, if none o&rsquo; them conner.&nbsp; Han yer got
anythin&rsquo; wi yer for me to read?&rdquo;&nbsp; I had a few
copies of &ldquo;Our Boys and Girls,&rdquo; with me, given to me
by the Wesleyan Sunday School Union, and I handed one to the old
woman, dated September 1880, and she began stammering at some of
the verses in an excited frame of mind between anger and
pleasure, as if determined to <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>read them whether she could or
not.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha,&mdash;Haste
traveller&mdash;ha&mdash;ha,&mdash;haste! the night comes
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; She got through one or two of the verses pretty
well.&nbsp; I then gave her another verse, which she read fairly
well:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He is our best and kindest Friend,<br />
And guards us night and day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I gave her another verse, but I could see tears in her eyes,
which prevented her getting through it as well as she
desired.&nbsp; She laid the fault to her being without
spectacles.&nbsp; Her reading these lines touched her very much,
and she became quite excited again, and jumped up and clutched
hold of both of my hands and said, &ldquo;Yer see, my good mon,
if none o&rsquo; the t&rsquo;other gipsies con read, I con,
conner I?&nbsp; But I con do more than read, I con say a lot
o&rsquo; the Bible off by heart.&nbsp; The Creeds, Church
Catechism, Belief, and Sacraments, which I larnt by heart when I
was a girl.&nbsp; I went to the Church Sunday School at
Uttoxeter.&nbsp; Yer&rsquo;ll see by that I have not allus been a
gipsy.&nbsp; When I got married to my old mon I had to go
a-gipsying wi&rsquo; him, and have never been in th&rsquo; church
since.&nbsp; My name&rsquo;s Bedman, of &lsquo;Ucheter,&rsquo;
and am well known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knelt upon the grass again, and supped a little more of
her strong tea.&nbsp; The number of Hinckley working people and
gipsies was increasing, and up she jumped again, clutching both
of my hands, after which she laid her hand in navvy fashion upon
my shoulder, and began to repeat the Creed: &ldquo;I believe in
one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and in
all things visible and invisible.&nbsp; And in one Lord Jesus
Christ, the only begotten Son of God,&rdquo; and on she went to
the end in her fashion.&nbsp; After this she knelt down again and
began with the Decalogue; &ldquo;God spake these words and said,
I am the Lord thy God; thou shalt have none other gods <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>but
me,&rdquo; and with a red face, and tears in her eyes, trembling
with emotion, she sung in the usual chanting tone, &ldquo;Lord
have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this
law.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old gipsy woman went on to the end, to
which I responded, &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some portions of the
Litany were repeated, and then she struck off at a tangent into
the Catechism, commencing with &ldquo;What is your name?&nbsp;
May Bedman.&nbsp; Who gave you that name?&nbsp; My godfathers and
godmothers in my baptism, wherein I was made a member of Christ,
the child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of
heaven.&nbsp; What did your godfathers and godmothers then for
you?&nbsp; They did promise and vow three things in my
name.&nbsp; First, that I should renounce the devil and all his
works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the
sinful lusts of the flesh.&nbsp; Secondly, that I should believe
all the Articles of the Christian Faith.&nbsp; And thirdly, that
I should keep God&rsquo;s holy will and commandments, and walk in
the same all the days of my life;&rdquo; and then she sung out,
&ldquo;Amen.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the old woman,
&ldquo;you see, my good master mon, I know a little, don&rsquo;t
I?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you know a
little, and he that knoweth his Master&rsquo;s will, and doeth it
not, &lsquo;shall be beaten with many
stripes.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old
gipsy, &ldquo;I do know my Master&rsquo;s will, and I have not
done it, and I&rsquo;ve been beaten with many stripes during the
last forty years, and here I am.&nbsp; Never mind, let bygones be
bygones.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord,
and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will
abundantly pardon.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; And I replied,
&ldquo;Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as
snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as
wool.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, you are right, bless you,&rdquo;
said the old backsliding gipsy, and with wet knees and wet eyes
she sang out again, &ldquo;Lord, <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>have mercy upon us, and incline our
hearts to keep this law,&rdquo; to which I responded,
&ldquo;Amen.&rdquo;&nbsp; I then left this penitent gipsy&rsquo;s
strong grips, the gipsy gang, and the number of lookers-on to go
to my &ldquo;quarters&rdquo; for my breakfast.&nbsp; I then spent
another half-hour with the Salvation Army.&nbsp; After a pleasant
conversation with the clergyman at my lodgings, I started
homeward, and on my way to the station I came upon one of my old
gipsy families, who were just having their breakfast in a very
filthy, tumbledown van, with their six poor ragged, dirty little
children squatting about on the bottom of it.&nbsp; The
good-hearted <i>posh</i> gipsy woman seemed to have lost all
spirit in her struggles to live a respectable traveller&rsquo;s
life, and was now with her children in the depths of despair and
poverty.&nbsp; She would insist on my having a cup of tea as I
sat upon the doorstep.&nbsp; I could not drink all of it, but did
the best I could under the circumstances.&nbsp; She persisted in
pressing me to take a cocoa-nut and a sponge for my little folk
at home, the cocoa-nut to eat and the sponge to clean their
slates with.</p>
<p>It is from two adjoining villages in the neighbourhood of
Hinckley that two of our present-day English tribes of gipsies
spring.&nbsp; Many years ago the father of one tribe was a
&ldquo;stockinger&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, one who makes
stockings&mdash;and he conceived the idea that he would like to
be a gipsy.&nbsp; Accordingly he set up a pedlar&rsquo;s
&ldquo;basket of trifles&rdquo; and began to stump the
country.&nbsp; From this small beginning there are now between
forty and fifty &ldquo;real gipsies,&rdquo; as some backwood
gipsy writers&mdash;who would delight in seeing this country
dragged backward into Druidism as a retaliation for their own
failure in the battle of life&mdash;would call them.&nbsp; Poor
little-souled mortals! they are to be pitied, or my feeling of
disgust at their wrong-doing would lead me to say hard things
about them.&nbsp; To be laughed out of school is a start bad
enough in the wrong road in all conscience, without a severe
probe from me.&nbsp; My pleasure would be to put out the <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>hand to
lead wrong-doers back to the wise counsel of a loving Christian
father, the decalogue, and the teaching of Christ.</p>
<p>The success of the first gipsies in their &ldquo;rounds&rdquo;
led the second lot to take up the &ldquo;profession,&rdquo; and
to-day we have two full-blown tribes of English gipsies in full
swing, tramping the country in vans, carts, surrounded in many
instances with dogs, dirt, wretchedness, and misery.&nbsp;
Sometimes they will be fraternizing with kisses, and other times
they will be quarrelling and fighting with each other to the
extent of almost &ldquo;eating each other&rsquo;s heads
off.&rdquo;&nbsp; In these two families there will be close upon
one hundred and fifty men, women, and children, and not more than
three or four out of the whole able to read and write a
sentence.&nbsp; It is truly heartrending to contemplate the
amount of evil that has been done in the country by these two
families of artificially-trained gipsies.&nbsp; Thank God, some
of them are beginning to see the error of their ways.</p>
<p>I bade the Hinckley gipsies good-bye, and having dined off a
slice of bread-and-butter fetched out of the corner of my bag, at
Nuneaton station, I made my way homeward.&nbsp; As I was mounting
the last hill on this bright, lovely Christian Sabbath day the
church bells were pealing forth&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Come to church and pray<br />
On this blessed day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. George Burden, the Leicester poet, author of &ldquo;The
Months,&rdquo; had heard something of the cry of the gipsy
children when he was prompted to send me the following touching
little poem:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;THE GIPSY
CHILDREN.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the remotest ages,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From many a lovely lane,<br />
The cry of gipsy children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To heaven hath risen in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Chorus</span>.&nbsp; Then rescue
gipsy children,<br />

197</span>Rambles among the Gipsies, Posh Gipsies, and Gorgios at
Long Buckby.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the Sunday night after my
visit to Hinckley I more than once thought that I was about to
enter the great unknown and unseen world of <i>T&aacute;tto
pa&aacute;ni</i> (spirits) from whence no <i>cho&oacute;rodo</i>
(tramp) returns.</p>
<p>After partaking of a light breakfast of the kind
<i>Mid&uacute;velesko</i> (Christ) and <i>mongam&eacute;ngro</i>
(beggars) eat, with my <i>Romeni</i> (wife), <i>Rackl&eacute;</i>
(sons), and <i>Raklia</i> (girls) at our plain-fare
<i>mis&aacute;li</i> (table), I began with some of &ldquo;<i>our
boys and girls</i>&rdquo; to wend my way through <i>poous</i>
(fields) and by-lanes and over rippling streams to Long
Buckby.&nbsp; I had not got far down one of the lanes before I
came upon a scissors-grinder (<i>posh</i>) gipsy, who, together
with his <i>joovel</i> (woman) and their six
<i>nongo-peer&oacute; chiklo chavis</i> (barefooted dirty
children), were <i>beshing</i> (sitting) upon <i>chiklo drom
rig</i> (muddy roadside) <i>rokering</i> (talking),
<i>chingaren</i> (quarrelling), <i>sovenholben</i> (swearing),
and eating their <i>shooker manro</i> (dry bread) for breakfast
and <i>pa&aacute;ni</i> (water) out of the rippling stream for
<i>m&uacute;terimongri</i> (tea).&nbsp; Their
<i>yogom&eacute;skro</i> (fireplace) was upon the <i>chik</i>
(ground); their <i>kair</i> (house) was a barrow covered with
rags.&nbsp; Although belonging to <i>Anghit&eacute;rra</i> <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>(England),
and priding themselves on being <i>Ga&uacute;jokones</i>
(English), not one of the eight men, women, and children could
tell a letter.&nbsp; <i>Sh&oacute;shi</i> (rabbits) were not to
be seen, and <i>kanegr&oacute;s</i> (hares) were out of sight,
where they <i>Taned</i> (camped).&nbsp; Rooks were
&ldquo;caw&rdquo;-cawing overhead;
<i>ba&uacute;ro-ch&eacute;riklo</i> (pheasants) and <i>ridjil</i>
(partridges) had flown.&nbsp; After a chat with them I
distributed a few pictures and little things to the <i>chabis</i>
(children), and then bade them good (<i>sa&uacute;la</i>)
morning.</p>
<p>A further trembling stroll by the hedges, ditches, daisies,
and buttercups brought me to the edge of the canal, where I sat
down to watch the darting, jumping, and frisking of the
<i>m&aacute;tcho</i> (fish) as they shot to and fro before
me.&nbsp; Every now and again a perch would pop up out of the
clear water, as if anxious to have a peep and a game, and then it
would, with a whisk of its tail, shoot off like an arrow.&nbsp;
The lark was singing overhead.&nbsp; While meditating, musing,
and observing upon the surroundings and unregistered and
uninspected canal boats and cabins packed to suffocation with
uneducated poor canal children, in face of an Act
passed&mdash;for which I worked <i>hard</i> and <i>long</i> from
1872 and onward to to-day, to prevent this sad state of
things&mdash;I began to aphorize, and entered into my pocket-book
the following aphorisms:&mdash;</p>
<p>Some little-brained, over-sensitive, dwarfish mortals, who
spend their time in running after little annoyances, may be
compared to a policeman running with his staff after a fly which
has been tickling the end of his nose on a summer&rsquo;s sunny
afternoon.</p>
<p>A clever man who has found his way into the gutter through his
own misconduct may be compared to a piece of granite, with a
rugged squarishness about him that would have enabled him to find
his upward way into the world and good society; instead of which
his ruggedness has been rubbed and kicked off, and to-day he is
as a <a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>boulder upon the pavement, and undergoing the process
of being kicked from pillar to post, with no reward for him but
the gutter.</p>
<p>A man who builds up his fortune out of ill-gotten gains, and
the grinding sweat of the poor, is feathering his nest in a dead
carcase that will stink long in his nostrils, notwithstanding
fine feathers, plausible excuses, and sanctimonious looks.</p>
<p>When present unhappiness is the outgrowth of honest conviction
and hard-working strivings, a crop of immortal pleasures will be
seen where least expected.</p>
<p>Immortal, golden fame is the everlasting perfume of eternal
flowers, grown out of immortal deeds, sown upon immortal soil by
unselfish hands, and watered by tears of sorrow shed in
trial&rsquo;s darkest hours.</p>
<p>When ignoramuses and fools mistake the artificial light of
science for that of the sun, it may be taken for granted that
they are in a fair way for having their fingers burnt in the
candle.</p>
<p>A shallow headed trickster, with a hungry belly and an empty
pocket, clothed in trickery, wringing the watery drops of
sympathy and benevolence from his nature to paint virtuous smiles
upon his face to deceive his friends while he lightens their
pockets of gold, for which he has never worked, has earned the
title of the devil&rsquo;s grave-digger, with <i>perfidus
fraudulentus</i> engraved upon the buttons of his coat.</p>
<p>Round boulder-stones are awkward things with which to build up
new churches, so are the round members of the community, without
principle, fidelity, and piety, awkward members of society to
found new Christian churches.</p>
<p>A London smoke prevents healthy vegetation, as do London
morals and influences prevent healthy spiritual life and
vigour.</p>
<p><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>A
loan office is a social whirlpool that has shipwrecked thousands
of honest families, and as the little ones have gone down they
have cried for help, but there has been none to deliver.</p>
<p>The man to gauge your pocket correctly is a lawyer, for he can
tell what filthy lucre you have in it with his eyes shut.</p>
<p>A lawyer&rsquo;s office is coated with birdlime, strong enough
to fetch the clothes off your back and keep you riveted to the
spot; and then the lawyer, with a laugh upon his face like
Solomon&rsquo;s leeches, cries out for more.</p>
<p>As rusty old nails put into pickle produce poison for the
body, so do rusty, deceitful old sinners put into social and
religious societies produce moral poison.</p>
<p>In the darkest heart, riven with anguish and despair, there
lies embedded in the human breast a spiritual vein that only
requires one touch of the match of heavenly sympathy to cause it
to shed seraphic lustre upon hellish actions, at once
transforming them into Divine.</p>
<p>A dandy is fashion&rsquo;s painted sparrow, whose wings will
be sure to be clipped, and who will find a final resting-place in
the gutter.</p>
<p>A gin-shop is the devil&rsquo;s headquarters, with the
landlord as his recruiting serjeant, and rags as the standard
colours of his army.</p>
<p>In all societies the devil has his &ldquo;gad-flies,&rdquo;
whose only mission in the world seems to be to sting and
annoy.</p>
<p>Slanderers and backbiters are the cats of hell, with eyes of
fire, poison-steeped claws, and tails of blood, running wild, and
woe be to those who come in their way.</p>
<p>As the light proceeding from the natural sun produces the
seven cardinal colours, viz., red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
indigo, and violet, and with a proper mixture of these colours a
spotless white is produced; so in like manner with the light
proceeding form the Son of God, <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>the seven cardinal graces are the
outcome of His glory, viz., love, joy, patience, faith, meekness,
temperance, and charity, which, when blended together in human
natures, produce a perfect Christian, reflecting His glory and
image.</p>
<p>Imagination is the ethereal unseen car that carries the twin
angelic sisters, love and sympathy, through space and matter to
visit the darkest and brightest spots of creation as a mission of
affection, consolation, reproof, help, and encouragement to every
fallen son of Adam.</p>
<p>A mother&rsquo;s prayers are a life-belt that has saved
thousands of young men and women from being lost amid the dark
storms and wrecks of life, until they have been lifted into the
life-boat and carried safe to shore beneath the silver rays of
Biblical truth, which the lighthouse of heaven has been shedding
o&rsquo;er the troubled waters dashing against the rocks of land
and rugged earth.</p>
<p>As the rose, pine-apple, and other deliciously scented fruits
and flowers send forth the best fragrance when clouds are the
darkest and lowest, atmosphere the heaviest, and rainstorms
flying threateningly about, so in like manner do the most
child-like, Christ-like, modest, and heavenly Christians send
forth heavenly graces tinted with seraphic splendour when the
storms of persecution are flying savagely about, afflictions
weigh heavily, and Providence hidden from view.</p>
<p>As the beautiful white snow that flappers and flickers about
us in winter appears shapeless and ragged to the naked eye, but
when seen through a microscope presents prismatic forms and
crystalline beauty beyond imagination, so in like manner the
blessings, bounties, and mercies of God do to the eye of sinful
nature and a bad heart; but when they are seen by the eye of
sincerity, child-like simplicity, and faith, then the beauty and
wonderful variety of God&rsquo;s goodness to us are manifested <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>as they
descend with heavenly stillness in our rooms and round our
paths.</p>
<p>Children seeking innocent, pure, and moral precepts among
wicked street boys and girls, are running barelegged and
barefooted after butterflies in a field of nettles and
thistles.</p>
<p>A bed of affliction is the &ldquo;gridiron&rdquo; upon which
God often puts His children when either their keel or
propeller&mdash;faith and love&mdash;gets out of order.&nbsp;
Sometimes when they have been very wayward, and have suffered
severely, nothing less than being run into &ldquo;dry
dock&rdquo;&mdash;afflictions and earthly losses&mdash;will meet
their case.</p>
<p>As pearls and other precious gems can be brought out of the
sea only by diving&mdash;no magnetic hand of an idle man is
powerful enough to cause them to swim&mdash;so can a Christian
fetch up the much more precious hidden mysteries of heaven by
retiring from the world and engaging in closet prayer, and diving
into God&rsquo;s wonderful system of Divine love.&nbsp; The gems
out of the sea adorn the body, while the pearls of heaven
beautify the mind, enliven the soul, put a lustre upon the
actions, and illumine the countenance with heavenly radiancy.</p>
<p>As the eyes and nose convey the delicious scents and beauty of
creation to the natural man, so in like manner do faith and
prayer convey to the soul the fragrance, delight, and beauty of
heaven.</p>
<p>A man who seeks to be a philanthropist for worldly fame, with
a heart full of pride, selfishness, vanity, levity, lust,
babbling, hate, and deceit, has a compass upon his ship out of
order.&nbsp; And he may also be compared to a vessel with eight
&ldquo;fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sles&rdquo; and no &ldquo;poop,&rdquo;
with helm to steer, trusting to his flimsy sails of false hopes
flappering in the breeze to guide him to heaven, but sure to run
him aground to hell.</p>
<p>The heavenly prayer of earth tinged with grief and <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>sorrow will
become the golden picture of heaven illuminated with joy and
tinted with God&rsquo;s radiant smile.</p>
<p>The face of a good man is the best heliograph in the
world.&nbsp; The heliograph used in war-time, as a signal, shines
best with the brightest sun, while the heliograph produced upon a
man&rsquo;s face by love shines best in the darkest hour.&nbsp;
Dismal cellars, squalid hearths, wretched garrets and prisons,
are good places in which to reflect a radiant splendour that will
last for ever.</p>
<p>To get a faint idea of God&rsquo;s goodness and infinite
splendour we have only to imagine all the leaves and petals of
vegetation, differing in shape and size, teeming with silvery
dewdrops of an infinitude of delicate tints, which, as they drop
among the flowers of earth, instantly turn into pearls and
diamonds of the first water; and while you are picking them up, a
doubling and multiplying process is everlastingly going on to
fill their places.&nbsp; So God gives, and so are the recipients
of His mercies, ever blessed with an infinite number of mercies
daily and hourly as we pass along.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After another slow walk I felt drowsy, and sat down upon a
mossy bank under a shady tree to rest my bones and wearied
limbs.&nbsp; The whistling of the sweet songsters and the
bleating of the sheep and lowing of the oxen, together with the
lovely summer&rsquo;s enchantments, sent me into a doze with my
elbows upon my knees.&nbsp; I had not been long in this position
before the meadow appeared as one vast gipsy encampment, composed
of tents, vans, dogs, wretchedness, misery, devilry, ignorance,
dirt, filth, and squalor.&nbsp; The gipsy men, women, and
children were playing, singing, preying, banging, shouting,
fighting, thieving, lying, swearing, poaching, cheating, and
fortune-telling to their hearts&rsquo; content.&nbsp; Among this
vast concourse of English gipsy heathens, there were not a few
&ldquo;spoony&rdquo; Gorgios, and <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>&ldquo;<i>posh</i>
gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; At one side of the meadow there was a gipsy
tent covered with rags and old sheeting.&nbsp; There were several
little lost gipsy children playing about it on the grass.&nbsp;
Near them stood two gipsy women talking to two silly young
ladies, and telling their fortunes.&nbsp; The young ladies, of
course, were both in love with fair gentlemen, but the fair
gentlemen would prove deceitful and dark gentlemen would take
their places; and they would marry well, after crossing the
water, and become rich, and have a number of children, who would
become dukes and lords, and would live and die rolling in gold
and splendour, with horses, carriages, and servants to wait upon
them &ldquo;hand and foot.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the young ladies,
with glittering wealth hanging about her, would have much trouble
and many disappointments before she realized her wishes, but all
would be removed and made right as time went on.&nbsp; One of the
old fortune-telling wicked hags, who could not read a letter,
took out a small pocket Bible, and pretended to read a few
verses.&nbsp; The old gipsies made a few signs, repeated some
gabble, and looked into the hands of the young ladies, and told
them to come again, as they had something of great importance to
tell them the next time, which would add much to their happiness,
beauty, and pleasure; but before the secrets could be successful
they must bring the best and most valuable ring they had in the
house for her to make crosses with, so that she might rule her
planet properly and dispose of the fair man, who was haunting one
of them to make her his wife, but would bring her to ruin.&nbsp;
To the other young lady an old gipsy woman said, in a kind of
snake&rsquo;s whisper, &ldquo;You, my dear young lady, have
living with you in your family a fair woman and dark man; they
don&rsquo;t mean you any good.&nbsp; You must have nothing to do
with them; be sure and hear what I say.&nbsp; Now mind, you must
not listen to what they say, or it will be your ruin, and all my
<a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>words of
counsel will turn to curses.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said
the young lady, &ldquo;there is no fair woman or dark man in our
house, except my father and mother.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old gipsy, &ldquo;hear what I have
to say.&nbsp; Your father and mother are no friends of
yours.&nbsp; Now mark that; goodbye, my sweet girl.&nbsp; The
Lord bless you, my dear girl.&nbsp; I shall see you again soon;
good-bye.&nbsp; Be sure and bring the best ring in the
house.&nbsp; Good-bye, and may the dear Lord bless you.&nbsp; If
you can bring two rings it will be all the better for your
happiness and fortune.&nbsp; The young gentleman who will be your
husband will never be cross.&nbsp; He will always be
smiling.&nbsp; He will be beautiful, and he will let you go where
you like and do what you like.&nbsp; Bring two rings for your own
sake.&nbsp; Good-bye, my darling child.&nbsp; I wish I stood in
the way for a fortune and happiness as surely as you do; but all
depends upon you bringing me the rings.&nbsp; Good-bye, my sweet
child.&nbsp; If you can bring me a spade-ace guinea, or a Queen
Victoria sovereign of the present year, it will be all the
better.&nbsp; I can influence the planets so that you can have
your dear charming little husband, horses, carriages, and footmen
to wait upon you earlier.&nbsp; The planets will do anything just
now.&nbsp; Good-bye, my sweet darling child.&nbsp; You are so
much like your dear aunt; she was one of the prettiest and best
ladies I ever knew, and it would be a thousand pities for you not
to have a good husband.&nbsp; Bring the two rings, and the guinea
or sovereign, and it shall be all right.&nbsp;
Good-bye.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the young lady,
&ldquo;I have not got any diamond rings and sovereigns.&nbsp;
They are my father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Never mind.&nbsp; Hear what I say; you must bring them if
you want to be happy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll influence the planets to
send your father and mother,&rdquo; said the old hag, closing her
fist, and with fire in her eyes, and a devil&rsquo;s anger in
heart, and frowns upon her face, &ldquo;more in their places of
greater value to them.&nbsp; The <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>planets will not be ruled, my dear
young lady, except by the rings that your father and mother have
worn; and the sovereign would be all the better if taken out of
either your father&rsquo;s or mother&rsquo;s pocket.&nbsp; The
gold and rings of your mother have the most influence with the
planets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the young ladies had gone, the woman winked at me with a
twinkle, and said, with her arm raised, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
spoil my game, and I will bless you.&nbsp; If all goes on right
we shall have lots of money the whole of the winter.&nbsp; If you
do spoil my game, I&mdash;I&mdash;I will curse you to death; to
death will I curse you, and shall call you a vile wretch for
ever; to death you shall be sent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this was going on, a little bird was singing in the
trees overhead, which caused the old gipsy woman to look up at it
and me, and in a softened voice said, &ldquo;What does it
say?&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;If you could but read it
rightly, it says, &lsquo;Be not deceived, God is not mocked; for
whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also
reap.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; This seemed to startle the old gipsy,
and she vanished into the crowd.</p>
<p>Among the crowd of gipsies I noticed several gipsy men
clustered together.&nbsp; In the centre of the group there was a
dead sheep.&nbsp; Sticker said to Nobbler, &ldquo;How did you
come by it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said
Nobbler.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it and that&rsquo;s enough,
but I may as well tell you a little.&nbsp; I went round the
villages a few miles away selling some pegs and skewers, and just
outside one of the villages there was a large lot of sheep in one
of the fields in prime condition, belonging to a farmer who, they
say, is a sleepy sort of a chap, and will never put any of the
bobbies upon your track.&nbsp; I conceived a liking for one of
the sheep.&nbsp; I knew Goggle Fletcher would be passing by the
end of the field in which the sheep were with his cart; and so I
hung about in the public-house in the village till it was
dark.&nbsp; I entered the field through a gap, and drove them
into a dry corner.&nbsp; I kept upon the tufts of grass as much
<a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>as I
could, so that I could not be traced.&nbsp; I was not long before
I made short work with one of them.&nbsp; After this I dragged
him to the ditch by the side of the road by which Goggles was to
pass.&nbsp; I lay in the ditch for a long time.&nbsp; It seemed
as if he never would come.&nbsp; At last about eleven
o&rsquo;clock he came.&nbsp; I could tell the sound of his
trap.&nbsp; On coming up to me I bawled out in a soft voice,
&lsquo;Goggles, Goggles, step down.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got
something for you.&nbsp; It will be a treat for Sunday&rsquo;s
dinner.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Is that you, Nobbler?&nbsp;
What!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been up to it again, have you?&nbsp; You
will have the &ldquo;long wools,&rdquo; if they are to be got,
without either love or money.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Goggles jumped
down and helped Nobbler to lift the sheep into the cart, and off
they bowled, arriving in the meadow about one o&rsquo;clock in
the morning.&nbsp; Gipsies always take their plunder far
away.&nbsp; The skin was buried, and they set to work dividing
the carcase among their kith and kin.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Another gang had been out on a poaching expedition with their
lurcher dogs, and brought to their tents and vans some hares,
rabbits, and pheasants; these were also divided.&nbsp; Among this
vast gipsy encampment, numbering some hundred men, women, and
children, I saw an aged couple of gipsies with some of their
grandchildren round them.&nbsp; The old woman had learned to read
the Bible a little, and she was telling the children to be good
and love God.&nbsp; She was the only one who could read among the
gipsies, except a few riffraff Gorgios, who were studying
gipsying with a view to leading an idle vagabond&rsquo;s life,
free from parental restraint and elevating social influences.</p>
<p>In the camp I noticed a <i>posh</i> gipsy
&ldquo;scissor-grinder&rdquo; from one of our alleys, and his
gipsy wife; every few minutes he bawled out, &ldquo;Scissors to
grind!&rdquo; &ldquo;Scissors to grind!&rdquo;&nbsp; While he was
grinding away at his knives and scissors, his wife was stitching
umbrellas and &ldquo;minding her baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>I
found that the man had had a good education at a high-class
school, but had taken the &ldquo;wrong turning,&rdquo; and now
spent part of his time in &ldquo;scissor-grinding,&rdquo; singing
gipsy &ldquo;slap-dash songs,&rdquo; and during the short days of
winter &ldquo;dotted down&rdquo; gipsy love tales, &amp;c.&nbsp;
He had smudged thickly over the soul saving golden letters
embedded in his memory in the days of childhood&mdash;as all
young men and maidens do who take to gipsying&mdash;the fifth
commandment: &ldquo;<i>Honour thy father and thy mother</i>;
<i>that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God
giveth thee</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor follow!&nbsp; I felt sorry to
see his dirty knees through the rents in his breeches.&nbsp; In
his childhood he had been taught by his Christian parents to lisp
as he knelt with his head bent low against his mother&rsquo;s
knees&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Teach me to live that I may dread<br />
The grave as little as my bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lay my body down to sleep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let angels guard my
bed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now he could sing out with his wife&rsquo;s
assistance&mdash;more jovially, of course, than Hubert Smith sung
it on his tramp to Norway&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s the king of the
gipsies&mdash;that&rsquo;s true,<br />
My mother, she learned me some camping to do.<br />
With a packet on my back, and they all wish me well,<br />
I started up to London, some fortunes for to tell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or more touchingly than Esmeralda sung</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Shul,
Shul, gang along with me;<br />
Gang along with me, I&rsquo;ll gang along with you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How much better it would have been for this scissor-grinding
<i>posh</i> gipsy if he had followed the advice that had been
given to him, and endeavoured to lead the poor lost wanderer upon
right paths to heaven instead of to hell.</p>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>A
gipsy&rsquo;s charges for &ldquo;grinding&rdquo; and
&ldquo;setting&rdquo; a pair of scissors vary from twopence to
two shillings and sixpence; all depends upon circumstance and who
owns them.</p>
<p><i>Posh</i> gipsies and others who encourage gipsy wrongdoing
know it to be misleading and evilsome; but it does not answer
their purpose to speak faithfully and truthfully about gipsy
wrong-doing.&nbsp; Gipsy idleness, gipsy frauds, gipsy cruelty,
gipsy filth, gipsy lies, gipsy thefts, gipsy cheating, gipsy
fornication, and gipsy adultery, are looked upon by all
enlightened Englishmen and Christians as sins to be avoided and
not to be encouraged.&nbsp; And he who encourages the gipsies in
this wrongdoing is an enemy to the State, an enemy to God, an
enemy to Christianity, and an enemy to himself, for which he will
be made to smart some day.&nbsp; Their ill-gotten coin will burn
their pockets and singe the hair of their head with terrible
vengeance.</p>
<p>To come again to the things I saw with my eyes shut while
lying under the shade.</p>
<p>Among the hundreds of gipsy children in this vast camp who
were going to ruin there were a few fast-goers, fools and fops,
fraternizing with the &ldquo;gipsy beauties,&rdquo; but no hand
was put out to help to save the children from woe.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;<i>gentlemen</i>&rdquo; were too busy to soil their hands
with the poor-ragged, forlorn, neglected, forgotten, and forsaken
gipsy children.&nbsp; They might live like heathen and die like
dogs.&nbsp; A thousand things must be attended to, and the souls
and bodies of the gipsy children might go to hell for aught they
cared.</p>
<p>Occasionally a gipsy child in this camp would begin to sing;
but, as Elton Summers in the <i>Christian World</i> Magazine for
1877, says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;More plaintive and low is its melody,<br />
Till, faint with its own sad reverie,<br />
It sinks to a whisper and dies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>As I
lay, I noticed a man, apparently about sixty years of age, with
grey hair, round features, and a load upon his back, coming
through the gate into the meadow.&nbsp; The nimbleness and
elasticity of his step had well-nigh gone.&nbsp; His clothes were
ragged and worn.&nbsp; He staggered along, and as he began to
move among the gipsies they began to add to his load.&nbsp;
Sorrow had furrowed his cheeks and a paleness was upon his
countenance.&nbsp; Every few minutes he seemed to hesitate and
stop, as if going to put his load upon the ground, in order to
move more quickly among them, and into a resting tent at the edge
of the meadow.</p>
<p>During one of his standstills I heard him with tears in his
eyes saying to himself, &ldquo;Shall I put the load down?&nbsp;
Yes, I think I will;&rdquo; and then he summoned up strength and
courage and said, &ldquo;No! no!&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t put it down
till I&rsquo;ve either carried it to where I want to carry it or
die in the attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently he staggered and fell heavily with his burden upon
the sod.&nbsp; He lay for a few minutes without any one noticing
him.&nbsp; After he had lain for some time a crowd began to
gather round him.&nbsp; Some said, with a chuckle and a grin,
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead, thank God!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve done with
him, thank God! and hope he has got into a warm
place.&rdquo;&nbsp; Three or four gentlemen pressed through the
crowd to look at the old man; and as they were going among the
bystanders I heard them say to each other, &ldquo;If he shows
signs of life we will give him a lift, but if he is going to die
we will have nothing to do with him.&nbsp; Let those see to him
who like, we will leave him to his fate, be it rough or
smooth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Like the priests and Levites of old, they
went on the other side.</p>
<p>Among the crowds in the ditches I noticed an old <i>posh</i>
gipsy woman from South Carolina Street, with basket in hand
picking up wasps, newts, and weasels.&nbsp; One of the gentlemen
noticed what she was doing, and questioned <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>her as to
her movements and intentions.&nbsp; She replied as follows,
&ldquo;You will see what I am going to do with them when I have
gathered my basketful.&nbsp; I hold in my pocket a bottle
containing some mixture that when once it is applied to the
basket will cause them to buzz, sting, and poison
fearfully.&nbsp; For the matter of that a few others will help to
do the same thing; and when this is done I am going to empty them
upon the poor devil&rsquo;s head to either poison or sting him to
death.&nbsp; Several here tried to do it before, but they were
fools and did not go the right way to work.&rdquo;&nbsp; One
gentleman said, &ldquo;Has the poor fellow ever done you any harm
or wronged you in any way?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I
don&rsquo;t know that he has, but I and a few others want to see
the end of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She filled her basket, and applied the mixture to the wasps,
newts, and weasels, and just as she was going to empty them upon
the head of the poor fellow, about dying, they turned and settled
upon her own pate, and away she went out of the crowd, and I have
not seen her since.&nbsp; By the side of the poor fellow lay a
small bag of seeds which were to grow bread, clothes, and
comfort, which a few friends had collected to help the old man on
his journey.&nbsp; It was not long by the side of the old pilgrim
before up stepped a little dodger who had taken to gipsying,
named Philip Lamb, from Russia, who seized the small bag and off
he scampered.&nbsp; The last I saw of him was that he was
tramping the country with patches upon his breeches.</p>
<p>While this was taking place, three or four other
gentlemen&mdash;real and not shams&mdash;appeared upon the
scene.&nbsp; For a few minutes they looked and stared at each
other, as if at a loss to know what it all meant, and what the
old man had done wrong.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said one and
another and another, &ldquo;it will never do to let the poor
fellow die in this way;&rdquo; and they at once set to work to
lighten his load, <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>and to give him some nourishment.&nbsp; After treatment
of this kind for a little time, he began to come round again, and
smiles were to be seen upon his face and the faces of his
friends.</p>
<p>Through one of the gates leading into this gipsy encampment I
saw running post haste a number of well-dressed young men and
women of respectable appearance, who were making their way to
three or four men from the Ionian Isles, who had disappointed
society and society had disappointed them.&nbsp; One man stood
upon a little hillock, piping forth, in slap-dash gipsy songs,
backwood novels, boshy stories, and gipsy lore, the beauties,
delights, and loveliness of gipsy life in a way that caused a
shivering, aching pang to run through my system from the crown of
my head to the soles of my feet.&nbsp; He continued to tell of
the pleasure of white lies, and taking things that were not your
own; and also in feeding upon things, whether birds, beasts,
fish, or game, that lived in the water that God gave us, or upon
the grass that He sent us.&nbsp; &ldquo;God,&rdquo; said these
gipsy sensualists, &ldquo;knew nothing of gates, fences, locks,
keys, bars, and bolts.&rdquo;&nbsp; These poor misguided young
folks listened with open mouths, and in the end they went into
the gipsy tents.&nbsp; They doffed their cloth, put on gipsy
garbs, tanned and washed their faces in walnut water, and sallied
forth into the crowd cadging and begging, lying and
stealing&mdash;as only gipsies can.</p>
<p>Among the crowd of gipsies farther away there were two or
three real Romanys who had &ldquo;begun to serve God,&rdquo; and
were distributing tracts among the gipsy children, at which the
scissor-grinding <i>push</i> gipsy turned up his nose.</p>
<p>On a little mound stood a little man with a <i>posh</i> gipsy
woman by his side, telling those round him that gipsies were
angels who had been wafted from India to our midst <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>by the
heavenly breezes of the Celestial City, and that their ragged and
tattered garments were the robes of Paradise, and whatever they
did, however dark and evil, was done under the influences of the
good spirit of gipsydom.&nbsp; One little sharp-eyed gipsy
fellow, named Deliverance Smith, from Kaulo-gav (Birmingham),
called out to the <i>push</i> gipsy, &ldquo;Sir <i>posh</i>
Gorgio, do you mean to say that these old rags I&rsquo;ve got on
have been made and put upon my back by angels; and that when I
swears, tells lies, fights, and steals, a good spirit has told me
to do so? because if you do, I say it is a lie, and know better
than believe your tale.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <i>push</i> gipsy called
the little fellow to him and said in a whisper, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t mean what I say, but I must say something to fill
people&rsquo;s mouths.&nbsp; These girls round me are fond of a
&lsquo;lark,&rsquo; and I like them.&nbsp; I know nothing about
the other gipsies.&nbsp; Keep your mouth shut, and here&rsquo;s
sixpence for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In some of the tents diseased <i>b&aacute;lamo-mas</i> (pork)
was being cooked; in others, <i>hotchi-witchi</i> (hedgehogs),
<i>kan&eacute;-gros</i> (hares), and <i>bouris</i> (snails).</p>
<p>Some of the poor children had never been washed for weeks,
except in walnut-water, which, by continual using, gives them the
artificial olive hue amateur gipsies admire.&nbsp; Those who are
sunfreckled are the hardest to tan.&nbsp; For a time the
sunfreckles are seen through the artificial sickly yellow colour
on their faces and hands.&nbsp; Some of the children told me that
they never undressed.&nbsp; The healthy appearance of former day
gipsies is fast passing away, and now, as a rule, they are pale,
thin, and sickly-looking.&nbsp; Many of the adults and children
were much pitted with the smallpox scars.&nbsp; They wore their
clothes till they dropped off.</p>
<p>Outside the encampment stood a number of my friends looking on
the scene, a list of whom will be found in my &ldquo;Canal
Adventures by Moonlight&rdquo; (p. 125), with recent <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>additions
since of a number of warm-hearted friends to the cause of the
canal and gipsy children.</p>
<p>Some few of the gipsies in this encampment had been married,
and that was the only time that they had ever been inside a
church; not one gipsy, young or old, had ever been inside a
school of any kind.&nbsp; Schoolmasters and ministers were almost
unknown to them.&nbsp; They had more acquaintance with policemen
and jails than churches and chapels.</p>
<p>Connected with one of the gipsy camps of ragamuffins, I
noticed in the distance a tall, thin, unwashed, and emaciated
girl of about fourteen winters&mdash;it had been nearly all
winter with her.&nbsp; The upper part of her thin frame of skin
and bones was dressed in a few shreds of rags, and these were not
sufficient to cover her bare, dirty bosom, which almost looked
the bosom of a skeleton; and on her feet were odd and worn-out,
cast-off drawing-room shoes, quite equal to the sad emergency of
letting as much mud and water upon her soles as they were to keep
the poor lost creature &ldquo;high and dry&rdquo; out of the
muddy surroundings.&nbsp; She moved among the gipsies with a
&ldquo;trash, trash,&rdquo; and a most downcast and haggard look
of despair upon her face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Despair&rdquo; seemed to
come with terrible vengeance and prominence out of every word,
form, movement, and gesture; except when occasional relapses
stole over her, and then the tear-drawing sympathy shone and
darted like darts of fire that pierced into the marrow of my
soul, bringing the flush and blush to my face, and tears to my
eyes, whether I would have them or no.&nbsp; No amount of
&ldquo;screwing up,&rdquo; or &ldquo;bottling,&rdquo; prevented
this appearance upon my cheek.&nbsp; The poor girl had fine
Grecian features, with long, black, flowing hair, but it was
matted together with dirt and filth.&nbsp; With her arms
uplifted, and her hands buried scratchingly deep in her hair, she
turned to look in the direction where I lay.&nbsp; This was <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>no sooner
done than, a flash of hope lighting up her thin face with smiles
through her tears, she started to run towards me as fast as she
could, calling out, &ldquo;My father! my father! my
father!&rdquo;&nbsp; Before I had time to turn round she was at
my side, and had planted a kiss upon my check.&nbsp; For a moment
I was dumbfounded.&nbsp; I said to the lost <i>posh</i> gipsy
child, &ldquo;What is it you want, my dear?&nbsp; I am not your
father.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this reply she looked wild and almost
like a maniac, and said, with her face buried in her hands,
&ldquo;I thought you was my father who had come to fetch me out
from among the gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then she looked again
into my face and said, &ldquo;Arn&rsquo;t you my father? my
father was so much like you.&nbsp; He had white hair like
you.&nbsp; Arn&rsquo;t you my father?&nbsp; I wish I could see my
mother.&nbsp; Will she come for me?&rdquo;&nbsp; I asked her to
sit down by my side, and to tell me who she was.&nbsp; She came a
little nearer, and began to tell me how it was she came to be
among the gipsies.&nbsp; I will give her tale as she related it
to me:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a little girl about four years old, I
remember my mother sending me for some milk to a house near to
the old General Baptist Chapel, Church Street, Deptford, <a
name="citation215"></a><a href="#footnote215"
class="citation">[215]</a> and while I was going down the street
some dark ragged women&mdash;the same you saw me with&mdash;asked
me to go down to the bottom of the street to look at some fine
things, and on the way they gave me a penny and some apples and a
little doll.&nbsp; After walking a long way we did not get to the
bottom of the street, but we got among a lot of children living
under a cart cover by the side of the hedge.&nbsp; They asked me
to sit by the fire that was on the ground.&nbsp; I said I wanted
to go to my mother.&nbsp; It <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>was getting dark, and I began to
cry.&nbsp; They kept saying that they would take me to my mother,
and at night they all got into a cart, and said they were taking
me home to see my mother, father, brothers, and sisters.&nbsp; We
went a long way, and the way they took me was not like Deptford,
and I have not seen my mother and father since.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
girl began to cry, and said, &ldquo;I should like to see father,
mother, Polly, and Jim.&nbsp; It is a long time since I saw
them.&nbsp; We used to go to school together, Jimmy, Polly, and
myself.&nbsp; My father used to take me by the hand to school and
chapel on Sundays, and they did sing such nice hymns.&nbsp; I
have seen father and mother cry lots of times.&nbsp; Father used
to say his prayers every night and morning.&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t say prayers where I live now.&nbsp; Will you take me
to my father and mother?&nbsp; When will you take me?&nbsp; Take
me now, and I will give you everything I have in the world.&nbsp;
Please don&rsquo;t go and leave me, and I will give you twenty,
thirty, forty, and fifty kisses.&nbsp; I will give you hundreds
if you will take me to my mother and father.&nbsp; I hope they
are not dead.&nbsp; I hope Polly and Jim are alive.&nbsp; Will
you take me, please, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told the poor little creature that I could not take her, but
that I would send three or four gentlemen for her shortly.&nbsp;
At this she began to sob out loudly, &ldquo;Take me! take me!
don&rsquo;t leave me here!&rdquo;&nbsp; I directed her to pray to
God for deliverance, for there seemed to be none from earth; and
with her eyes turned up to heaven she said with Sir John
Davis:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lord! hear my prayer and listen to my
cries,<br />
Let not Thy gracious eye my tears despise.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which I said, Amen!</p>
<p>Large numbers of them had been in jail.&nbsp; Their short
cropped hair and other symptoms told the black tale.</p>
<p>All the vans, tents, &amp;c., were not to be reckoned as
teeming with human wretchedness, squalor, dirt, filth, <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>and
sin.&nbsp; Some ditch and mossy bank abodes were as clean as the
circumstances would admit of, and the tent and van dwellers were
healthy-looking, plump, and clean.</p>
<p>A terrible row commenced among the gipsies over a dog, which
ended in bloodshed and murder.&nbsp; Right up at the far corner
two men were digging a hole about two feet six inches long, and
twelve inches wide, and two feet deep.&nbsp; After it was dug a
woman stole stealthily along with a heavy parcel in her arms,
covered with a cloth, which might or might not have been a dead
dog.&nbsp; As the gipsy woman carrying the mysterious bundle
approached, one of the men withdrew to act as a kind of spy
guard.&nbsp; For a few minutes he looked about, and then called
out crouchingly, and in a loud whisper, &ldquo;The skies are
clear.&rdquo;&nbsp; The woman ran with death in her arms, the
devil in her heart, and a hellish glare upon her features, and
deposited her load in the cold, cold ground without a tear or a
sigh.&nbsp; No mournful <i>cort&eacute;ge</i> or funeral knell
told the tale of what was going on.&nbsp; Within three minutes
all was levelled up, and the three departed&mdash;where I
don&rsquo;t know; at any rate, I have not seen them since.</p>
<p>Immediately after this sad event I saw coming down the by-lane
a School Board officer, a sanitary officer, and a Christian
minister.&nbsp; I watched with longing eyes to see what they were
going to do.&nbsp; They came nearer and nearer, till they arrived
at the gate leading into the meadow.&nbsp; For a few minutes they
stood at the gate, which was locked.&nbsp; I liked the looks of
them.&nbsp; They looked like brothers of mercy.&nbsp; Their
countenances were heavenly.&nbsp; I felt that I could have
shouted &ldquo;Glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; I hastened to unlock the gate,
and the brothers of mercy walked in to lift the children upon the
path leading to heaven.&nbsp; Just at this juncture a
thunderstorm came on, and the dripping from the leaves overhead
woke me up.&nbsp; For a few minutes I did not know where I was,
whether in the body or out <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>of it.&nbsp; Feeling as Anna Shipton
felt when she wrote in the <i>Sword and Travel</i> for
1871:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou knowest my way&mdash;how lone, how
dark, how cheerless,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If Thy dear hand I fail in all to see;<br />
Bright with Thy smile of love my heart is fearless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When in my weakness I can lean on Thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I pulled myself together to deal with sad, terribly sad,
facts, and continued my walk to Long Buckby, my midday reverie in
the land of shadows, lying between dreams and visions, being
over.&nbsp; On mounting the hill leading into the town I met with
a tall old man dressed in a pauper&rsquo;s garb, and with a
&ldquo;few slates off.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said he had lived in a
cottage with the windows nailed up for seventy years.&nbsp; I
asked him how old he was.&nbsp; He answered, &ldquo;Over
seventy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He next turned the compliment upon myself,
and said, &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;&nbsp; I said,
&ldquo;Fifty-one.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the old
man, after looking at my once black hair, which my friends tell
me is now growing snowy white in the cause of the children,
hastened by the bleaching of hard struggles, conflicts, and
fightings, &ldquo;you are older than me; I thought
so.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said &ldquo;I did not think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are some quaint, ancient-looking houses in the town,
evidently of the time of the Commonwealth.&nbsp; These are built
of stone at the bottom, mud in the middle, and brick at the top,
and they are thatched with straw and end in smoke.&nbsp; In the
centre of this &ldquo;radical town,&rdquo; peopled with
good-hearted folks, stands a very strong, tall, oak pole, some
eighty feet high, with a crown upon the top of it, which pole was
taken many years ago out of Earl Spencer&rsquo;s park at
Althorp.&nbsp; It is known by the name of &ldquo;the coronation
pole.&rdquo;&nbsp; The original &ldquo;coronation pole&rdquo; was
put up when George III. was crowned, and was cut down in William
IV.&rsquo;s time, owing, as one of the very old townsmen said,
&ldquo;to his turning Conservative.&rdquo;&nbsp; A man named
Hare, whom I had a chat with, helped to saw it <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>down with a
&ldquo;cross-cut&rdquo; saw.&nbsp; It was sold publicly for two
pounds, and the money spent in drink in a public-house
opposite.&nbsp; The present pole stands some twenty yards from
where the former one stood.&nbsp; The massive crown upon the top
of the pole is similar to the one worn by our blessed and noble
Queen, and long may it remain.</p>
<p>In the square, and beneath the shadow of the &ldquo;coronation
pole,&rdquo; were some six vans, &amp;c.&nbsp; In three of the
vans there were eighteen children of all ages and sizes, seven
men and women.&nbsp; None of the children could tell a letter,
but three of the men and women could read and write.&nbsp; One of
the travellers, the father of six of the children, had received
his education at the Bedford Grammar School.&nbsp; With these
good-hearted people I had some tea, and they gave me a cocoa-nut
to take home for my family.&nbsp; I gave the children some
pictures and a few articles of clothing for one or two or three
of them, and then wended my way among the feasters and
fair-goers.&nbsp; In the &ldquo;feast&rdquo; there was a woman
with a &ldquo;rock stall,&rdquo; who had been a Sunday-school
scholar, but was now gipsying the country with her two
sons.&nbsp; They slept under their stall at night.&nbsp; She said
she thought that God did, and believed he would, answer the
prayers of backsliders before any others, to which I said,
&ldquo;Amen; He does and will.&rdquo;&nbsp; I left her with tears
in her eyes for a gossip with Mr. &ldquo;Flash&rdquo; and his
dark-eyed, sharp, business wife, who with steam horses and
shooting galleries are making money fast, so that they may
&ldquo;retire in their old age.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Flash&rsquo;s
life, struggles, and various vicissitudes present plenty of
material for a backwood gipsy novel of the blunder-bosh kind.</p>
<p>Flash and his wife were just having a ham tea, and they
invited me to join them, which of course I did, and rubbed my
hands quickly with delight.&nbsp; It was a prime cut, the
frizzling and frying of which brought water to my teeth and a
smacking of my lips.&nbsp; I was served with tea out of <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>one of
their best old china cups, which was a treat every one had not
the pleasure of enjoying.&nbsp; After my gipsy rambles I
thoroughly enjoyed the late tea.&nbsp; They showed me their
beautiful feather bed at the end of the van, and unbosomed some
of their successes and some of their trials and hardships.&nbsp;
I gave them a few pictures, which they said they should have
framed.&nbsp; They then filled my bag with &ldquo;prize
onions,&rdquo; and I shook hands with them, to meet again some
day, perhaps at Bagworth or Barleston, in Leicestershire, where
Flash first saw daylight.</p>
<p>Not one of this batch of <i>posh</i> gipsy travellers raised a
murmur against my plan for bringing about a free education for
the gipsy and other travelling children, and the registration of
their vans.</p>
<p>Just under the glittering crown and &ldquo;coronation
pole&rdquo; stood what, so far as the underworks indicated, had
been once an old fish cart, over the top of which had been placed
some half-barrel hoops, covered with old tarpauling sheets.&nbsp;
The outside woodwork consisted of pieces of orange boxes, packing
cases, &amp;c., and was daubed over with paint little better than
a child would daub a pigstye door.&nbsp; The dirty patches and
blotches of glaring colours were laid on in an infinitely more
zigzag fashion than the trailmarks of snails and worms.&nbsp; The
creaking <i>door</i> was hung with pieces of leather; in fact,
the whole outside, together with the pieces of old leather
straps, and string-tied-together harness, old rags, buckets, and
boxes underneath, presented a sight that I shall never
forget.&nbsp; All this family of Y&mdash;ks wanted to make them
perfect gipsies was that they should pick up some gipsy slang,
Romany, learn how to eat hedgehogs, snails, and diseased pork,
tell lies, gabble out fortunes, poison fowls, choke pigs,
throttle sheep, take all, by hook or by crook, they could lay
their hands upon, wash their faces in walnut water, roll about in
mud and filth, smoke and eat &ldquo;black jack,&rdquo; and adopt
the gipsy names of <a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>Smith, Lee, Boswell, Hearn, Lovell, Fletcher, Simpson,
Draper.&nbsp; With these gipsy traits brought out they would be
enabled to live a roving, lively, idle time of it to their
hearts&rsquo; content.&nbsp; So say some gipsy writers.&nbsp;
What a contrast, I thought, as I saw some young ladies standing
at the window of a large house looking upon the scene only a few
yards away.&nbsp; There a piano, played by gentle, nimble
fingers, was sending forth sweet notes of heavenly, charming
music sometimes at a galloping pace, and at other times as the
gentle murmuring of clear rippling waters over bright and glossy
pebbles, echoing love upon earth and peace and goodwill in the
air, turning the widow&rsquo;s sorrowful tears, the business
parent&rsquo;s troubles and care drops, into silver
stepping-stones leading onward and upward to heaven.&nbsp; For
the life of me I could not help showing my weakness by lifting up
my eyelids to make room for the scalding tears that wanted to
force their way down my cheeks.&nbsp; The wide chasm there is
between human happiness and heaven and human woe and hell is
something horrifying and horrible.&nbsp; Would to God that our
sensual, sensational, and degrading backwood gipsy writers could
be brought to see the mischief they are doing by dragging the
poor lost gipsies and other travellers down to utter ruin, body
and soul, for all time and throughout eternity, by their damning,
poisonous writings.</p>
<p>Inside the van, on the doorsteps, and upon the shafts of their
old tumbledown cart, there were man, woman, and five
children.&nbsp; The father and mother could read and write well,
but not one of the children could tell a letter, although of
school age.&nbsp; The eldest girl of fourteen was the picture of
beauty, though terribly thin from the crown of her head to the
soles of her feet; but alas, alas! a few rags, ignorance,
exposure, poverty, dirt, and wretchedness were trying to do their
best to spoil it.&nbsp; The other children, so far as I was able
to judge, were equally pretty.&nbsp; Owing <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>to my not
being an amateur gipsy, a backwood gipsy slang and book writer,
of course I do not set myself up as a connoisseur in these
matters.&nbsp; The father was inside the old van stirring the
boiling &ldquo;rock,&rdquo; which was in an old saucepan upon a
little six-inch square stove similar to what I have seen in
cobblers&rsquo; shops before now.&nbsp; He was a big strong man,
apparently capable of any amount of work.&nbsp; The rags of
bedding were grimy, greasy, and dirty to the last degree; in
fact, soap and water did not appear to have been brought to bear
upon anything in the wretched hole.&nbsp; How man, woman, and
five children could sleep in such a place is a mystery.&nbsp; God
grant that it may be soon solved by the hand of our legislators,
philanthropists, and Christians of every grade.</p>
<p>The owner of this travelling van was an engineer and
&ldquo;fitter,&rdquo; and could, if he followed his employment,
earn over two pounds per week.&nbsp; One hundred and seventy
pounds was paid by his parents as an apprenticeship premium for
him to learn the trade; but, sad to relate, it was ending in his
boiling &ldquo;rock&rdquo; upon the top of a stove in the midst
of dirt and filth.&nbsp; This precious dainty, composed of flour,
sugar, treacle, and grease, was to be dealt out by his wife and
children by halfpennyworths to little successful popgun
firers.&nbsp; What an occupation and ending for a tradesman in
possession of strength, sense, and reason!&nbsp; He had been well
brought up by Christian parents, but got among loose company,
whose chief desire is to be unshackled and free.</p>
<p>The little gleam of light in favour of his future reform was
that he seemed to be ashamed of putting his head outside the
van.&nbsp; His conscience was not quite dead.&nbsp; May the
thundering voice of heaven ring in his ears till he cries out as
the poor prodigal did, and once more settles down again in the
neighbourhood of Thirsk.</p>
<p>The woman had been a parlour-maid for three years in <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>the family
of R&mdash;, at Sowerby Bridge, in Yorkshire, where this family
hails from.&nbsp; She seemed a hard-working woman, and one who
tried hard to make her way, but possessed with an idea that she
should like to see some of the London gipsies.&nbsp; No doubt by
this time she is making her way there.</p>
<p>The hardships this poor woman and children had to pass through
during the last year are most heartrending.</p>
<p>During the whole of one month, with occasional assistance of
the father, they had pushed their van about Lincolnshire in the
depths of dark, cold, cold winter.&nbsp; They had no horse, and
they presented a too wretched spectacle for daylight
travelling.</p>
<p>After their day&rsquo;s work of popgun-firing and
&ldquo;rock&rdquo;-selling at fairs, feasts, and races they put
one or two of the little children who could not toddle alongside
their van to <i>bed</i>&mdash;and bed it was&mdash;and commenced
crying, pulling and hauling their van up hill and down dale till
they got stuck fast at one of the Lincolnshire towns.&nbsp; By
begging, cadging, and starvation the woman managed to scrape two
pounds and some three or four shillings together, and off she
started by rail from Heckington to Spilsby fair to buy a
horse.&nbsp; She had left the children without a morsel of
anything to eat.&nbsp; Every penny had been screwed and scraped
together to make up the two pounds.&nbsp; She wandered about the
fair all day, but could not succeed in buying a horse for two
pounds.&nbsp; The horses were being gradually driven off the
ground, the poor woman had had only a dry crust to eat, sat down
and began to cry; in fact, while she was telling me her sorrowful
tale of hardship and suffering, tears rolled freely down her
face, and she kept breaking out in sobs and &ldquo;The Lord love
you&rdquo; many and very many times over, with such an effect
upon my poor self that I had but little rest that night.&nbsp; I
was quite unnerved, and emptied my pockets of what little money I
<a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>had
among the poor little <i>posh</i> gipsy children.&nbsp; While the
woman was sitting in her sorrowful fix a man came up to her and
asked her what was the matter with her.&nbsp; The poor creature
unbosomed herself, and told him.&nbsp; They both there and then
began to hunt up the old horses left in the fair; finally they
met with one for two pounds&mdash;the grey old pony they had with
them standing by the side of the cart when I saw them&mdash;and
an animal it was, such as one does not see every day for bruises,
humps, and hunches.</p>
<p>At four o&rsquo;clock, with darkness creeping on, and a halter
upon the pony&rsquo;s head, she commenced to tramp, dressed in
rags and trashes, and almost an empty craw, from Spilsby back to
Heckington, a distance of between thirty and forty miles.&nbsp;
Fortunately there was a little moonlight for a good part of the
night, which enabled her to get upon the pony&rsquo;s back to see
the guide-posts.&nbsp; Several times she took the wrong turning
where there was no guide-post to direct her, but by perseverance
righted herself again.&nbsp; The pony was a little lame, and she
could not ride, and on they tramped together, occasionally
resting by the road side as the silent hours of the cold winterly
night quietly and leisurely passed into the future unseen and
unknown, except such of it as has been revealed to us by the
Great Creator Himself.&nbsp; About two o&rsquo;clock the next day
she arrived at the van door with her old grey pony, and since
then they have travelled hundreds of miles together, sometimes
pushing, and sometimes pulling along the lanes of life.&nbsp; I
asked her if she was not afraid to travel along the lonely lanes
and roads leading to Spilsby at the midnight hour.&nbsp; She
answered, &ldquo;The Lord love you, I should at other times, but
I did not feel a bit afraid on this night.&nbsp; I wanted to get
home with the pony and to see my children, and this kept me
a-going forward.&nbsp; Since then,&rdquo; said the poor woman,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve had a hard time of it; in fact, for the last
two <a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>years we&rsquo;ve had only six pennyworth of meat, and
six pennyworth of bacon in the van.&nbsp; We live on what we can
pick up, but chiefly on dry bread and tea.&rdquo;&nbsp; She told
me herself that for more than a fortnight together she had on
only an old dress, a chemise in shreds, and a pair of old boots
to move among the fashionable and gay at the fairs, races, and
feasts.&nbsp; Thank God for the hope that dwells within the
breasts of these at the bottom of the social scale that brighter
days will come.&nbsp; Her little girls had not been undressed and
washed for weeks, as they had nothing else to put on while they
were being washed; and in this way many thousands of English men,
women, and children are drifting into damning English gipsy
customs, sins, and degrading and depraving habits, beneath, and
encouraged by, the smiles, winks, and gabble of our backwood
gipsy, gem collectors, and sentimental and sensational writers,
who do not care a straw for those whom they are enticing on to
ruin, so long as the gold and silver bits drop into their
pockets.</p>
<p>It is time we roused ourselves, and, with Mr. Ellis in the
<i>Quiver</i> for 1878, cried out at the top of our voices, and
in prayer from the depths of our whole souls&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, help them, then, if ye are men,<br />
Stretch out thine hand to save.<br />
Let them not sink beneath the brink<br />
O&rsquo; the surging ocean wave.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Sunday</span> morning, September the 24th,
was most lovely and delightful.&nbsp; The buzzing and darting
bats were not to be seen.&nbsp; They had retired among the ruins
of old tumbledown walls, creaking doors, and thatch.&nbsp; The
horrible sneaking rats had crept into their holes, ashamed of
daylight.&nbsp; The owl had retired to a dark, dusky nook among
the perishing barn stone walls, to sleep and fatten upon its
ill-gotten carrion and the tender bones of the sweet chirping,
variegated songsters that had been unfortunate enough to come
beneath its ravenous clutches.&nbsp; The bright sun was shedding
its light, tinged with a little of the autumnal golden hue, upon
our rough, rugged, and antiquated dwelling.&nbsp; The robin
seemed more proud than ever to <a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>show its beautiful red breast, and
to get ready to pipe forth the praises of Jehovah from the
branches of the old yew trees near the orchard.&nbsp; The
swallows were darting by our windows, as if nervous about their
long flight, and anxious to have as many peeps at us as possible
before bidding us good-bye for their long journey far, far
away.&nbsp; Our fowls had, according to their usual custom on
Sunday mornings, gathered themselves together under the shed in
the yard to listen to the intonation of their friend
&ldquo;Tom.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sheep and cattle were grazing in the
meadows, and sheaves of golden corn stood upright in the fields,
inviting the farmers to carry them home to fill the barns of the
rich, the coffers of the banker, the empty bellies of the poor
widow, toilers in the field and brickyard, dwellers in canal-boat
cabins, and gipsy tents, vans, and wigwams.&nbsp; Our village
church bells had begun to ring, and my wife was, of necessity,
breaking the Sabbath by restoring with her bodkin and thread some
of my habiliments while I stood bolt upright, so as to make me
presentable at court, which process caused a twitter among our
&ldquo;olive branches.&rdquo;&nbsp; I now scraped together all
the money I could, and with my &ldquo;Gladstone bag&rdquo; in
hand, containing among other things my Sunday&rsquo;s dinner,
consisting of a slice of bread and butter and an apple, and my
seedy-looking overcoat, turned the best side towards London, I
started to the station.&nbsp; The bells were chiming and pealing
soft and low, and our little folks were tripping off to church
with their curls dangling down their backs, and dressed in their
best &ldquo;bib and tucker.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the way I came upon
an Irishman sitting upon a stone minding some sheep that were
munching grass by the roadside.&nbsp; For his companion he had,
as the Rev. Mr. Vine says in the <i>Wesleyan Methodist
Magazine</i>, February, 1877,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Naught but the sky, the rough hewn
rocks,<br />
Green belts of grass, and fleecy flocks.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>To me
it seemed as if he had a small crucifix in his hand, and was
counting beads; if so, I interrupted him by calling out
&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; to which Pat responded, &ldquo;Good
morning, yer honour; an&rsquo; it is a fine morning, yer
honour.&rdquo;&nbsp; I left him in his devotion, and next came
upon a couple of dirty shoemakers from Daventry, with as much
watercress in their arms as they could carry, stolen from the
water-brook close by while the farmers were in church and the
dogs tied up.</p>
<p>I now ran against a youth from the station who was gathering
blackberries.&nbsp; At his feet, in the hedge-bottom, a hare was
quietly nestling.&nbsp; Poor fellow! he let his blackberries fall
to grasp the hare, which allowed him the moment&rsquo;s pleasure
of catching its tail, but, much to the chagrin of the youth, did
not leave it behind, forcibly illustrating the case of the dog in
&AElig;sop&rsquo;s Fables crossing a plank with a piece of meat
in its mouth, which it let fall to grasp the shadow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the flushed youth, &ldquo;I nearly caught
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the train there were several gentlemen.&nbsp; One was
reading the <i>Christian World</i>, and another was reading a
sporting paper.&nbsp; At Nuneaton I had two hours to wait for the
next train to Leicester.&nbsp; The interval was spent in pacing
backwards and forwards upon the platform, and in eating with a
thankful heart my Sunday&rsquo;s dinner, which, not to say the
least of, was not too rich for my digestive organs.</p>
<p>I fared better than an old gipsy woman, Boswell, who, with her
daughter-in-law&mdash;a gipsy Smith from London&mdash;and their
five poor half-starved gipsy children, came to our door
recently.&nbsp; The old woman, Boswell, had only an outer old
frock upon her, with two or three old rags underneath.&nbsp; She
had no &ldquo;shift&rdquo; on, as she said.&nbsp; This family of
travelling gipsies consisted of two men, mother and
daughter-in-law, and five children, the whole of whom <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>&ldquo;slept under their tilted barrow&rdquo; at Buckby
wharf in a hedge-bottom.&nbsp; Not one of this lot could tell a
letter.</p>
<p>At Nuneaton I conversed with a gentleman who gave me a little
of his history, some of which was remarkable, especially that
part relating to his courtship and marriage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said my friend with a tone of sadness, &ldquo;I
had the misfortune to lose my wife by cruel death, and was left
with four little children to get through the world as best we
could.&nbsp; It was a sad blow, sir.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
whether you have ever undergone such a trial, but my experience
of it is that it is one of the greatest misfortunes that can ever
befall mortal man, and I&rsquo;ve nothing but pity for the man
who has had to undergo the sad loss.&nbsp; Oh! it&rsquo;s
terrible, sir.&nbsp; After you have been toiling hard all day in
the cold rain, frost, and snow, and then to go home to find no
one to warm your slippers, or to speak a kind, soothing, and
cheering word to you, was more than I could bear.&nbsp; To sit
and eat your bread and butter and drink your tea alone, while the
servants and the children were playing in the streets, was enough
to turn any man into a wild animal.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said to him,
&ldquo;Certainly it is a terrible ordeal, and one that I should
not like to pass through.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes it is,&rdquo;
said my friend, almost in whimpering tones.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
how did you get out of your sad difficulty?&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, sir, things went on for some months in a path in
which there seemed nothing but vexation.&nbsp; The servants were
quarrelling, the children were neglected, and bills seemed to be
coming in without end; and while I was brooding over these things
one afternoon, in came a minister from Derby, and he saw the fix
I was in, and that I could not get him as nice a cup of tea as
formerly; and, to help me out of my difficulty, he said,
&lsquo;My dear brother, when the proper time comes, I know where
there&rsquo;s a wife that will suit you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Do
you?&rsquo; I said to my ministerial friend.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I do.&rsquo;&nbsp; At this I
<a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>pricked
up my ears, and he said, &lsquo;I am going to their house for tea
next week, and if you like you shall go with me.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; Nothing more passed that
evening on the subject.&nbsp; During the week he wrote to me,
asking me to meet him at Derby station.&nbsp; Of course I thought
I would go; they could not take anything of me, and I went.&nbsp;
In going to the house I began to get into a nervous stew.&nbsp;
On the way my friend said, &lsquo;Now there are two sisters in
the house living with their mother.&nbsp; It will be the one with
a blue ribbon round her waist who I think will suit you.&nbsp;
After they have been in their room to dress for the afternoon she
generally comes out the first.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;All
right,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my eyes
open.&rsquo;&nbsp; At the door the mother met us, and gave us a
hearty welcome.&nbsp; The young ladies were in their room, and I
was playing with my fingers upon the arm of the sofa.&nbsp;
Presently a young lady came downstairs.&nbsp; Of course I had my
eyes upon the waistband, to see whether it was a blue one; but,
to my astonishment, it was green.&nbsp; In a few minutes the
other young lady came downstairs with the blue ribbon round her
waist.&nbsp; I concluded that this was the one my friend the
parson had selected for me.&nbsp; Tea was got ready, and instead
of entering freely into the general conversation, I kept looking
first at one and the other of the young ladies at tea, and
playing with my fingers between time.&nbsp; When tea was over and
the service ended, on the way home my friend the parson said,
&lsquo;Well, which of the two do you like best?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not particular;
I&rsquo;ll take to either of them; but as the eldest is nearer to
my age, I think I will make love to her,&rsquo; taking it all as
a joke.&nbsp; Nothing more was said.&nbsp; During the next week I
was a long way from home on business, and I ventured to write to
Deborah, telling her who I was, and what little game I was up to,
and asking her to meet me at the station to have a chat together
on the subject <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>about which I wrote.&nbsp; The young lady was, so
I&rsquo;ve been told since, dumbfounded, and said to her sister,
&lsquo;Of all the men in the world I will not have him; I
don&rsquo;t like him a bit.&nbsp; He did not at all seem to make
himself comfortable at tea.&nbsp; I shall not go to meet
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the other sister with
the green waistband, &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t go I shall.&nbsp;
He will suit me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the one
with the blue waistband, &lsquo;if he will suit you he will suit
me, and I will go to meet him at the station.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Accordingly I got out of the train, so that she might know me
again, and on we went to Derby and made matters square;
and&mdash;would you believe me, sir?&mdash;in three weeks from
that time we were married.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Well,
bless me!&rdquo;&nbsp; The rapidity of his courting expedition
almost took the wind out of me.&nbsp; The station bell now
rang.&nbsp; I jumped into the train, and as I was moving off
towards Leicester I bade my new friend good-bye; and he, in
return, waving his hand, said, &ldquo;I will tell you the rest
another day, and what we saw on our wedding tour in London,
Antwerp, Brussels, Mastricht, Rotterdam, and
Amsterdam.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I said, and we
puffed away, leaving quite a pother behind.</p>
<p>In the train were two young female &ldquo;school
teachers,&rdquo; who had been a &ldquo;gipsying&rdquo; to
Coventry by the &ldquo;special&rdquo; from Leicester on the
Saturday afternoon, and, whether by accident or design, they had
been left behind.&nbsp; I questioned them about the suspicious
circumstance attached to such a course, to which they replied,
&ldquo;As soon as we arrived at the station, and found that the
train had been gone five minutes, we nearly cried our eyes
out.&nbsp; Fortunately we had friends in Coventry with whom we
stayed all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told them to be good girls and do better for the future, to
which they replied, &ldquo;We will,&rdquo; and I left them to
make my way down Belgrave Gate to my sister-in-law&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
After tea we went to St. Mark&rsquo;s church, and heard a <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>smiling
young curate, the Rev. A. F. Maskew, preach a good, practical,
telling sermon, on the occasion of returning thanks to Almighty
God for the success that has attended our army and navy and the
termination of the war in Egypt.&nbsp; The Rev. C. B. &mdash; was
away on his holiday.&nbsp; After the service the congregation
stood up and heartily joined the choir in singing, &ldquo;God
save the Queen.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which I responded with all my
heart, &ldquo;Amen!&nbsp; God bless our blessed Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Right always comes right.&nbsp; After service I took a walk,
with &ldquo;a young lady&rdquo; of some forty-five gentle summers
and hard winters at my left side, to visit the new park in the
abbey meadows.&nbsp; The sight was most enchanting.&nbsp; Few
lovers were on the walks with their arms entwined round each
other&rsquo;s waists.&nbsp; The artificial lakes, hills, and
rockeries were seen with solemn grandeur by the aid of distant
lamps.&nbsp; The moving murmuringly forward of the
&ldquo;soar&rdquo; waters beneath our feet, as we stood on the
bridge, lighted up with silver streaks of distant lamps, and the
pealing forth of the soft, heavenly, riveting, and mesmerizing
hymns and chimes of the evening bells of St. Mark&rsquo;s and St.
Saviour&rsquo;s, made me feel that all the troubles, trials,
opposition, misrepresentation, and hardship I had passed through
were suddenly transformed into pleasures, leading up to the
indescribable panoramic views that appeared before my
vision.&nbsp; As it passed away&mdash;or, I should say, I passed
from it&mdash;another one opened up which led me on and on in
spirit to the heavenly rest and everlasting beauty in
store.&nbsp; The Rev. Richard Wilton says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let Nature&rsquo;s music still the ear
delight,<br />
And gracious echoes mortal cares allay,<br />
Till &ldquo;wood-notes&rdquo; &rsquo;mid angelic warbling
cease,<br />
And &ldquo;church bells&rdquo; ring us to eternal
peace.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a few minutes after this I was between the sheets, <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>and I could
have said with John Harris, as sleep stole gently into my
room&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hark!&nbsp; What is that?&nbsp; The spirit
of the vale?<br />
Or is it some bright angel by the lake?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the last I remember was, I was muttering over
&ldquo;by&rdquo; &ldquo;by&rdquo; &ldquo;the&rdquo;
&ldquo;lake,&rdquo; &ldquo;by&rdquo; &ldquo;by&rdquo;
&ldquo;the&rdquo; &ldquo;the&rdquo; &ldquo;lake,&rdquo;
&ldquo;la&mdash;la,&rdquo; and I was bound fast to the bed.</p>
<p>A quondam friend bade me &ldquo;good morning,&rdquo; and then
jumped into a &ldquo;first class&rdquo; to recite his
&ldquo;R&rsquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;S&rsquo;s&rdquo; so as to give
them the finishing touch correctly the next Sunday morning, while
I enjoyed the honour and pleasure of a &ldquo;third.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We arrived together at Nottingham, and I made my way to a
&ldquo;temperance hotel,&rdquo; not half a mile from the station,
with &ldquo;first-class&rdquo; appearances outside, but with
&ldquo;third-class&rdquo; bedroom accommodation.&nbsp; My room
was a &ldquo;top back,&rdquo; overlooking well-known old friends,
viz., bricks, tiles, terra-cotta, sanitary pipes, encaustic
tiles, &amp;c, with a board in the corner covered with oilcloth
for a washing stand, and a tea saucer for a &ldquo;soap
tray.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bed was hard, and the blind was of a
material that needed no washing; in fact, the room was bare,
cheerless, comfortless, and cold.&nbsp; I strolled into the
market-place, and was soon talking to some old-fashioned
Staffordshire gipsies with short skirts, and apparently, thick
legs, heavy boots, with plenty of colour about their
&ldquo;head-gear,&rdquo; who, taking all things into
consideration, were not bad specimens of gipsies of the present
day.</p>
<p>After this I spent a short time with my old friend, Mr.
William Bradshaw, a name which has been well known in the midland
counties for many long years.&nbsp; Writing and gossiping
consumed the remainder of the day; and at ten o&rsquo;clock I
mounted and climbed nearer heaven to rub my eyes again at peep
o&rsquo; day.&nbsp; Between four and five o&rsquo;clock I was in
and out of my hard bed a <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>dozen times, guessing the time and
groping in the dark, for fear I might miss the train to Bulwell
Forest.&nbsp; At last I got so fidgety that I was determined to
get up, &ldquo;hit or miss.&rdquo;&nbsp; I dressed, and then went
downstairs to find my way out into the street; but, not having an
angel, like Peter, to open the doors for me, I had to ring and
ring and shout sufficient to awaken all in the house; if they had
been as deaf as posts, I could not have had a greater difficulty
to awaken them.&nbsp; At last the landlord made his appearance
with his shirt on, and his hair on an end like a frightened
ghost.&nbsp; Owing to my early movements, and being a
suspicious-looking customer, I had to pay my bill, and out I went
about half-past five.&nbsp; My train started for Bulwell at six
o&rsquo;clock, and at six thirty I was among the gipsies upon the
forest.&nbsp; There were four vans full of gipsies of all sorts
and sizes, just turning out of their &ldquo;bed;&rdquo; so dirty
were they that I should not have been surprised if the
&ldquo;beds&rdquo; had run away with them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Smiths&rdquo; and &ldquo;Winters&rdquo; were the two
prominent names.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless me,&rdquo; I said, there are
&ldquo;gipsy Smiths here, there, and everywhere.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, you are right, my good mon,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gipsy
Winter in a Staffordshire twang.&nbsp; In the four vans there
would be twelve adults and eighteen poor, rough, dirty, neglected
little gipsy children, not one of whom could read or write.&nbsp;
The policeman said to me, &ldquo;The gipsies that come on this
forest and about these parts are a rough, dirty, bad lot, and no
mistake.&nbsp; Nowt comes amiss that they can lay their hands
upon, I can assure you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had a chat with Mrs. Gipsy
Winter, and told her what my object was, viz., to bring their
vans under registration, and also to give their children a free
education; to which she replied with delight, &ldquo;Lor, bless
you, my good mon, I&rsquo;m reight glad you big fokes are going
to do sommat in the way o&rsquo; givin&rsquo; our childer a bit
o&rsquo; eddication, for they&rsquo;re nowt as it is.&nbsp; <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>They are
growin&rsquo; up as ignorant as osses; they conner tell a
&lsquo;b&rsquo; from a bull&rsquo;s foot.&nbsp; I conner read
mysen, but I should like our childer to be able to read and
write.&nbsp; Han you got one o&rsquo; your eddication pass books
wi&rsquo; yer? cause if yer han, I&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo;
one.&rdquo;&nbsp; I told her that the Act was not passed
authorizing the use of them; at which she held down her head, and
said, &ldquo;I suppose we mun wait a long time fust.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it will not be this
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gipsy Winter had upon her finger a Masonic
ring&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a ring with the &ldquo;square&rdquo; and
&ldquo;compasses&rdquo; engraved upon it.&nbsp; Of course I felt
sure she was not a Freemason, and did not proceed to put her to
the test.&nbsp; There never was but one woman a Freemason, and
the reason was that she secreted herself in an old clock case
while the ceremonies were being performed in the Lodge
&ldquo;close tiled.&rdquo;&nbsp; The only way out of the awkward
difficulty was to make her a Mason forthwith on the spot, and
this&mdash;so Masonic squib and report has it&mdash;was
done.&nbsp; This report of &ldquo;our Masonic sister&rdquo; is to
be taken with a pinch of snuff.</p>
<p>I called to see a family of gipsy Woodwards who have taken a
house and are settling down the same as other folk.&nbsp; Those
of their children that are able to work are working at the
coalpits close by, and the children of school age are sent to
school.&nbsp; In the course of time they will become as other
workers, helping on the welfare of the country, and at the same
time securing their own comfort and happiness.&nbsp; The house
did not present the appearance of a fidgety old maid&rsquo;s
drawing-room, but they are up the first steps towards it.&nbsp;
Time and encouragement will bring it round in the sweet
&ldquo;good time coming.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait a little
longer, boys; wait a little longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is complete bosh, nonsense, wickedness, and misleading
folly for frothy novelists to say that it is impossible for
gipsies to settle down to industrious habits and a <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>regular
life.&nbsp; I know full well they can, and are willing, many of
them, to settle down, if means be taken to bring it about.&nbsp;
I will only mention one case, to illustrate many others, viz., a
gipsy I know well, who is as pure a gipsy as it is possible to
find at this late day.&nbsp; The good old man has had a settled
home for forty years, and goes to hard work night and morning
amongst the farmers, the same as other labourers do.&nbsp; Aye,
and many times he works late and early, dining at times off a
crust and a cup of cold water with a thankful heart in the
week-day, and sings God&rsquo;s praises on Sundays.</p>
<p>To come back again to Bulwell Forest.&nbsp; After I had
visited the Woodwards I turned into a small coffee-shop to get a
cup of tea; and while I was enjoying the penny cup of tea with a
halfpenny&rsquo;s-worth of bread and butter for my breakfast, the
landlord said: &ldquo;One of the young gipsy rascals of the
forest came into my shop last week, and made himself too friendly
and free with some things that lay upon the table, for which I
could have put him into jail; but I did not like to follow it up,
and the lot of them have made themselves scarce
since.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another old woman, a seller of the
<i>Nottingham Daily Journal</i>, <i>Nottingham Daily
Guardian</i>, <i>Express</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, said, &ldquo;The
gipsies often come into my house and want to tell me my fortune;
but I always tell them that I know it better than they can tell
me, and will have no cotter with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I next came upon a gipsy named L&mdash;, who told me of a case
of gipsy kidnapping which took place at Macclesfield a year ago,
viz., that of a gipsy woman stealing a pretty little girl of
tender years out of the streets, belonging to a fairly well-to-do
tradesman living in the town.&nbsp; Although the child was
advertised for a long time, and large rewards offered, it was not
to be found, till one day a gipsy girl went to one of the shops
in Macclesfield to sell some gipsy &ldquo;clothes
pegs.&rdquo;&nbsp; The good woman of the house <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>came to the
door.&nbsp; Although five long years had passed away, tears had
been dried up again and again, and hundreds of prayers had gone
upward to Him who hears prayers and sighs, and the child had
grown big and brown, and was dressed in rags and filth, the
mother recognized the poor gipsy child standing at her door
hawking &ldquo;pegs&rdquo; as her own dear little darling
&ldquo;Polly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without waiting for the lost child to
be washed, dressed, and its hair combed, she embraced her darling
little lost daughter covered in rags with fond kisses, which told
a tale through the gipsy dirt upon the child&rsquo;s face, as
only a tender-hearted, loving mother can, and straightway called
in her friends and neighbours, and said, &ldquo;Rejoice with me,
for I have found this day my long-lost little darling
Polly.&rdquo;&nbsp; A policeman was sent for, the kidnapping
gipsy woman was traced, and was sentenced to eighteen
months&rsquo; hard labour in jail for her wrong-doing.</p>
<p>I was also told of gipsies who are undergoing long terms of
penal servitude for horse-stealing, their favourite
game&mdash;sheep stand second on the list.&nbsp; Donkeys are very
low down upon their list, as they are not worth &ldquo;shot and
powder.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If a gipsy should get
&lsquo;nabbed&rsquo; for stealing a donkey, it would be looked
upon in the eyes of the bobbies,&rdquo; said my gipsy friend,
&ldquo;like stealing a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A whirl, twirl, puff, and a whiz landed me upon the platform
in the &ldquo;Health Department&rdquo; at the University College,
Nottingham, September 26, 1882, with my bags, books, and papers,
among the large gathering of Social Science magnates and doctors,
to discuss&mdash;firstly, the Canal Boats Act Amendment Bill of
1881, which I am humbly promoting; and secondly, &ldquo;The
Conditions of our Gipsies and their Children, with
Remedies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among others upon the platform there were
Mr. Arnold Morley, M.P., Mr. W. H. Wills, M.P., Mr. Whately Cook
Taylor, Chairman, one of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Chief Inspectors of
<a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>Factories; Mr. H. H. Collins, Hon. Secretary of the
Health Department; Mr. J. Clifford Smith, Secretary to the Social
Science Association; and in the body of the hall there were Dr.
Hill, the Medical Officer of Health for Birmingham; Mr. Walter
Hazell, Mr. Russell of Dublin, and a large gathering of ladies,
&ldquo;too numerous to mention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had expected to find a large opposition force confronting
me, consisting of those who would keep the canal and gipsy
children in their present degraded condition; but, like the
Midianitish host, the breaking of my cracked pitcher had
frightened them out of their wits, and they had scampered off to
the hedges and ditches to skulk in front of me again another
day.&nbsp; No doubt with my papers, Gladstone bag, spectacles,
&amp;c., I presented very much the appearance of &ldquo;Mrs.
Gamp&rdquo; at her speechifying table.</p>
<p>These are my papers with all their faults and living seeds,
sown and planted at the Master&rsquo;s bidding, in the midst of
much toil, hardship, and persecution; which seeds will bring
forth a little eternal fruit some day&mdash;maybe, when my work
is done, and I have been called home to rest with the little
ones.</p>
<h3><i>The Condition of our Gipsies and their Children</i>,
<i>with Remedies</i>.</h3>
<p>In the year 1514 the gipsies landed in Scotland from the
Continent, and from that date to the present time we have had in
our midst over 30,000 men, women, and children with increasing
numbers, going to and from our villages, towns, lanes, and fairs,
and mixing with the simple, wise, gay, and foolish, leading the
lives of vagabonds, demoralizing all they have been brought in
contact with, by their lying, plundering, dirty, filthy,
cheating, and crafty habits.&nbsp; In one word, the gipsies have
been, and still are, a disgrace to Christian civilization.&nbsp;
Of course <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>there are exceptions among them, and I wish from the
bottom of my heart that there were more.</p>
<p>They live huddled together regardless of either sex, age, or
decency, under hedges, in tents, barns, or on the roadside, with
but little regard for marriage ceremonies.</p>
<p>Their food, in many instances, is little better than garbage
and refuse, and the most riff-raff of them bed themselves upon
rotten straw.</p>
<p>We have also, at this late day, with sunny education gleaming
on every hand, over 30,000 poor gipsy children of school age
growing up as vagabonds, and not two per cent. of the whole able
to read or write a sentence.</p>
<p>If our present-day gipsies had been of the romantic type of
some two or three centuries ago, as pictured to us so beautifully
by fascinating novelists, we might have wandered down the country
green lanes, and by the side of rivulets, to admire their
witchery, colours, and gipsy traits, exhibited with much refined
skill, artistic touch, and feeling by gipsy writers; but the fact
is, to state it plainly, the romantic gipsy of novels and romance
has been dead long ago, and neither the stage, romance, nor
imagination will ever bring him to life again in this
country.</p>
<p>Our gipsies of to-day are neither more nor less than ignorant,
idle tramps, scamps, and vagabonds.&nbsp; This I know full well,
for I have found it out over and over again, not by hearsay, but
by mixing and eating with them in their wretched abodes often
during the last five years.</p>
<p>My sorrowful experience of them forty years ago, with casual
acquaintances since, and onward to 1878, has not brought any
traits of their character, as practised by them, that any
sane-thinking, loyal, or observing man can admire, and the sooner
our legislators deal with our gipsy vagabonds the better it will
be for us as a nation.</p>
<p><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>Many
of the gipsies have large hearts, and are most kindly, and they
are also clever and musical.&nbsp; These features of gipsy life I
have witnessed myself many times.&nbsp; The cause of their
degraded position may be laid at the door of our Christian
apathy, legislative indifference, social deadness, and
philanthropic neglect.</p>
<p>The flickering and uncertain efforts of missionary agency will
do something towards reclaiming our poor lost wandering little
brothers and sisters, but not a tithe of what the social,
sanitary, and educational laws of the country can do.</p>
<p>In the paper I had the honour to read before this Congress at
Manchester, in 1879, I dealt more especially with the evils of
gipsy life, only referring briefly to my remedy, the substance of
which I have published in my &ldquo;Gipsy Life,&rdquo; and in
various forms since 1878, and onward to this date, which, with
additional suggestions, are as follow:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I would have all movable or temporary habitations
registered and numbered, and under proper sanitary arrangements
in a manner analogous to that provided under the Canal Boats Act
of 1877.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Not less than 100 cubic feet of space for each female
above the age of twelve, and each male above the age of fourteen;
and not less than 50 cubic feet of space for each female under
the age of twelve, and for each male under the age of
fourteen.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; No male above the age of fourteen, and no female
above the age of twelve, should be allowed to sleep in the same
tent, or van, as man and wife, unless separate sleeping
accommodation and suitable ventilation be provided.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; A registration certificate to be obtained, and
renewable annually at any of the urban or rural sanitary
authorities in the country, for which the owner of the tent, or
van, shall pay a sum of 10s., commencing on the first of January
in each year.</p>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>5.&nbsp; The compulsory attendance at day schools a
given number of times of all travelling children, or others,
living in temporary or unrateable dwellings up to the age
required by the Education Code, which attendance should be
facilitated and brought about by means of a free educational pass
book, procurable at any bookseller&rsquo;s, for the sum of one
shilling, as I have suggested to meet the case of canal
children.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; The children to be at liberty to attend any National,
British, Board, or other day schools under the management of
properly qualified schoolmasters.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; No child under thirteen years of age to be engaged in
any capacity for either hire or profit, unless such child shall
have passed the &ldquo;third standard&rdquo; of the Education
Code.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; No child or young person to work for either hire or
profit on Sundays under the age of sixteen.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Power to be given to any properly qualified sanitary
officer, School Board visitor, inspector, or Government official,
to enter the tents, vans, shows, or other temporary or movable
dwelling, at any time, or in any place, and detain them if
necessary, for the purpose of seeing that the law is properly
carried out.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; The Local Government Board to have power to appoint
one, or two, or more officials to see that the local authorities
enforce and carry out the Act; and also to report to Parliament
annually.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; All fines to be paid over to those authorities who
enforce the Act and the regulations of the Local Government
Board.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; As an encouragement to those gipsy wanderers who
cannot afford to have healthy and suitable travelling vans and
other abodes, and who desire to settle down from their wandering
and degrading existence to industrious habits the Government
should purchase common or waste <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>lands, or allot lands of their own
to the gipsies in small parcels upon a long lease&mdash;say for
ninety-nine years&mdash;at a nominal rent.</p>
<p>With these features embodied in an Act of Parliament, and
properly carried out by the local authorities, under the
supervision and control of the Local Government Board and
Education Department, gleams of a brighter day might be said to
manifest themselves upon our social horizon, which will elevate
our gipsies and their children into a position that will reflect
a credit instead of a disgrace to us as a civilized nation.</p>

<p><i>The Canal Boats Act of</i> 1877, <i>and the Amending Bills
of</i> 1881 <i>and</i> 1882.&nbsp; By <span class="smcap">George
Smith</span>, of Coalville.</p>
<p>In 1877 an Act was passed entitled &ldquo;The Canal Boats Act
of 1877,&rdquo; on the basis sketched out by me in a paper I had
the honour to read before this Congress, held at Liverpool in
1876; and also in my letters, articles, &amp;c., which have
appeared in the lending journals, and in my works since the
passing of the Act and onward from 1872 to this date.</p>
<p>After the Bill was drawn up, and during its progress through
committee in 1877, several features were foreshadowed in the
measure which led me to fear that when passed it would not
accomplish all we so much desired, and these I pointed out to the
late Lord Frederick Cavendish, the Right Hon. W. E. Forster, Mr.
Salt, Parliamentary Secretary to the Local Government Board; Mr.
John Corbett, M.P., Mr. Pell, M.P., Mr. P. Rylands, M.P., Mr.
Sampson Lloyd, MP., Mr. W. E. Price, M.P., and <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>many
others; but rather than yield to the opposition of the Canal
Association, and the loss of the Bill, I suggested that it should
be passed, notwithstanding the drawbacks that were in sight.</p>
<p>When Lord Frederick Cavendish, Mr. Price, and others, at the
fag end of the session of 1877, put the question seriously to me,
as to whether the Bill should not be massacred along with the
other innocents, I replied as follows: &ldquo;Push the Bill
through Committee by all means.&nbsp; A piece of a loaf is better
than none.&nbsp; It has its defects, but if we do not get the
Bill passed this year we shall not be likely to do so next
year.&nbsp; Let us get the thin end of the wedge in.&nbsp; The
operation of the Act will be to bring about the registration of
the canal boats, to give power to the sanitary officers to enter
the cabins, to secure the education of the 40,000 canal children,
and also to prevent overcrowding in the cabins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first step towards carrying out the Act, after five
years&rsquo; continued agitation and visits to various parts of
the country, has been fairly accomplished; and the sanitary
officers, by the power given to them under the Act, have done
good by preventing, in some degree, the spread of infectious
diseases; but the main features of the Act, viz., the education
of the canal children, the prohibition of overcrowding in the
cabins, and the annual registration of the boats, are almost
entirely neglected.</p>
<p>The following are the failing points of the Act of 1877:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Act to a great extent is permissive.&nbsp;
2.&nbsp; Proceedings cannot be taken against the boatmen and
boatowners for evading the regulations of the Local Government
Board&mdash;the most important of all.&nbsp; Breakers of this Act
can be brought under the lash of the law, but breakers of the
regulations cannot.&nbsp; 3. The Act of 1877 is placed in the
hands of the local registration authorities to carry out,
consequently the expenses fall upon the ratepayers, and <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>the result
is that the local sanitary inspectors, or registration officers,
have had but little added to their salaries&mdash;in many
instances nothing&mdash;and with strict orders not to go beyond
their town or city boundaries.&nbsp; Thus it will be seen that
boats plying between the registration districts, which are as a
rule between twenty and fifty miles apart, are left to
themselves.&nbsp; 4. Another oversight in the Act is the
non-annual registration of the boats, and consequently there have
been no fees to meet the expenses.&nbsp; It was intended from the
first that there should be an annual registration of the
boats.&nbsp; 5. The want of power in the Act to enable the Local
Government Board to appoint officers to supervise, control,
inspect, enforce, and report to Parliament upon the working of
the Act and the regulations.&nbsp; 6. Another cause of failure in
the Act has been owing to power not having been given to
inspectors to enter the cabins or inspect the boats at any other
time than &ldquo;by day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Boats are more or less on
the move by day, and it is only when they are tied up&mdash;which
generally happens after six o&rsquo;clock&mdash;or when they are
being loaded or unloaded, that the local registration officer has
an opportunity to see or to form any idea as to what number of
men, women, and children are sleeping and huddling together in
the cabins.&nbsp; 7. The Act does not give the School Board
officer power to enter a boat cabin.&nbsp; The education clauses
of the Act have, I might almost say, entirely failed: (<i>a</i>)
owing to the indifference manifested by the school authorities at
which places the boats are registered as belonging to; (<i>b</i>)
the extra trouble they give to the school attendance officers;
(<i>c</i>) the facilities given and the chances seized by the
boatmen to get outside the town or city boundaries with their
children so as to elude the grasp or shun the eye of the School
Board officer.&nbsp; 8. The payment of a week&rsquo;s school fees
demanded from the children who can only attend one or two days in
the week.&nbsp; It is not <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>either fair, honest, or just to
compel a boatman to pay more for the education of his children
than others have to pay.&nbsp; 9. Many boats in the coal
districts, with women and children on board, travelling short
distances, have escaped registration and inspection under the
plea that their boats are not used as dwellings.&nbsp; 10.
Another very important reason advanced by the registration
authorities why the boatmen and boatowners have not been
prosecuted for breaches of the Act is that all the trouble and
expense attending prosecutions have had to be borne by the local
ratepayers, while the fines, in accordance with the Act of 1877,
have been paid over to the county fund, instead of the borough or
local fund.</p>
<p>The Bill I am humbly promoting, and which has been before
Parliament during the last two sessions, supported by Lord
Aberdare, Earl Stanhope, Earl Shaftesbury, the Marquis of
Tweeddale, Mr. Samuel Morley, M.P., Mr. Albert Pell, M.P., Mr.
John Corbett, M.P., Mr. Thos. Salt, M.P., Mr. Thos. Burt, M.P.,
and Mr. H. Broadhurst, M.P., provides a remedy for these faulty
places.&nbsp; 1. I would do away with the permissive features of
the Act of 1872.&nbsp; 2. Fines to be inflicted for breaches of
the regulations, as well as for breaches of the Act.&nbsp; 3. I
give under the Act the local registration authorities part of the
registration fees.&nbsp; I propose that the annual registration
fee should be 5s. for each boat, one half of this amount to go to
the Government, and the other half to the local
authorities.&nbsp; 4. The registration of the boats to be
annual.&nbsp; This will be a very simple and inexpensive affair,
no matter in what registration district the boat happens to be at
the time of the renewal.&nbsp; 5. I give under the Bill the Local
Government Board power to appoint one, two, or more officials to
visit the canals in various parts of the country, and to see to
the proper enforcement of the Act, and to report annually to
Parliament.&nbsp; 6. I propose that the inspectors <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>should have
power to enter a canal boat at any &ldquo;reasonable
hour.&rdquo;&nbsp; 7. No child shall be employed on a canal boat
unless such child shall have passed the &ldquo;third
standard.&rdquo;&nbsp; 8. I propose that children, whom the
regulations allow to live in the cabins, should have a free
educational pass book, which would enable them to attend any day
school while the boats are being loaded and unloaded.&nbsp; 9. No
child under the age of sixteen to work on a canal boat on
Sundays.&nbsp; 10. All boats upon which there is accommodation
for cooking or sleeping to be deemed to be used as
dwellings.&nbsp; 11. All fines to be paid over to those
authorities who enforce the Act.</p>
<p>When the Canal Boats Act of 1877 is amended in accordance with
the lines I have laid down in the Bill, the stigma that has been
resting upon the country and our canal population, numbering
nearly 100,000 men, women, and children, during the last 125
years, will be in an easy way for removal, without inconvenience
or costing the country one farthing, and the boatowners and
captains not more than 2s. 6d. each per annum.</p>
<p>With the proper carrying out of the Act the 40,000 boat
children of school age, not ten per cent. of whom can read and
write, will be educated, and the boatmen&rsquo;s homes made more
healthy and happy; industrious habits will be encouraged, and the
country will also be made richer by increasing the happiness of
her water toilers upon our rivers and canals.</p>

<p>My papers passed off in the midst of smiles and kindly and
lengthy <i>press notices</i>.&nbsp; Editors have always been more
kind to me than I have deserved, much more than I had <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>anticipated.&nbsp; The fact is, I had expected some
rough handling, and armed myself with a few little rough, awkward
facts.&nbsp; Perhaps it was fortunate for me that the majority of
my hearers were of the gentler sex.&nbsp; Bless their dear
hearts!&nbsp; Their encouraging smiles and words have helped me
through many a difficulty in pushing on with the cause of the
children.&nbsp; May God reward them a thousandfold.</p>
<p>The act was ended, and the curtain dropped.&nbsp; I therefore
&ldquo;picked up my crumbs,&rdquo; and bade my friends goodbye
till&mdash;D.V. and if all&rsquo;s well&mdash;we meet again next
year at Huddersfield.&nbsp; I then made my way to the station,
and home.&nbsp; Upon Leicester platform I met with a few old
friends, who had pleasant greetings for me, including Mr.
Thompson, Mr. Fox, and a literary friend, the Rev. W. L. Lang,
F.R.G.S., who has given myself and the cause I have in hand many
lifts&mdash;bless him for it.&nbsp; Onward and upward may he
travel to the time when it shall be said, &ldquo;It is
enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to my many other friends who have helped
me by their influence and with their pens, I repeat the same
thing over and over again.</p>
<p>My little stock of the &ldquo;one thing needful&rdquo; had
begun to turn quite modest, and crept into the corners of my
pocket, so as to be scarcely felt among the keys of boxes,
drawers, cupboards, and lockers, knives, and other pocket
trifles.&nbsp; I took my ticket to Rugby, which left me with one
shilling.&nbsp; I had not gone far before my ticket was missing
out of my hand.&nbsp; I was in a minute &ldquo;all of a
stew.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cold perspiration crept over me.&nbsp; In a
twinkle, before any one could say &ldquo;Jack Robinson,&rdquo; my
hands were at the bottom of my pockets using their force to
persuade Mr. &ldquo;Ticket&rdquo; to turn up; but no! it was not
to be found.&nbsp; Fortunately a porter came panting after me and
asked if I had not lost my ticket.&nbsp; He had lifted a ton
weight off my shoulders, and I thanked him very much.&nbsp; At
Rugby I spent my last coin in copies of the <i>Times</i>,
<i>Standard</i>, <i>Daily News</i>, <i>Telegraph</i>, <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span><i>Daily
Chronicle</i>, <i>and Morning Post</i>.&nbsp; In nearing our old
antiquated village along the lovely green lanes, little village
children were to be seen gathering blackberries.&nbsp; The sun
was shining most beautifully in my face.&nbsp; The autumnal tints
and hues were to be seen upon the trees.&nbsp; The gentle
rustling wind brought the decaying and useless leaves
hesitatingly and in a zigzag fashion to the ground, as if they
were loath to leave the trees which had given them birth, before
settling among the mud to be trampled upon by tramps and
gipsies.&nbsp; While climbing the last hill, with a heavy heart
and light pocket, weighed on all sides with nervous hope,
trembling doubts, and anxious fears, I never more fully realized
the force of John Wesley&rsquo;s hymn, as I tried to hum it
over.&nbsp; In soft but faltering accents I might have been heard
by the village children singing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No foot of land do I possess,<br />
No cottage in this wilderness.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A poor wayfaring man,<br />
I lodge awhile in tents below,<br />
Or gladly wander to and fro,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till I my Canaan gain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing that caught my eye upon my library table was a
letter from Mr. Samuel Morley, M.P., in which was enclosed a
cheque to aid in building a Good Templar hall at Northampton,
about which I had written.&nbsp; This was duly sent to Mr.
Hollowell, the secretary.&nbsp; Underneath Mr. Morley&rsquo;s
letter lay one from a friend, Mr. Frank A. Bevan, of 54, Lombard
Street, enclosing a small cheque on behalf of himself, Lord
Aberdare, and a number of friends, to help me in my work, and to
provide for the daily wants of my little ones, till we arrived at
the next stile on our rough, steep, and somewhat zigzag
journey.&nbsp; The sight of his cheque sent a thrill of joy
through my soul, and I could not help shouting out,
&ldquo;Thanks! a thousand times.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>Light
again dawned at eventide, and we were enabled to retire to rest
singing God&rsquo;s praises as the candle flickered in the
socket.</p>
<p>In my &ldquo;Gipsy Life&rdquo; I have shown, among other
things which have never been mentioned by any gipsy writer
before, the following particulars.&nbsp; First, the cause and
probable date of the gipsies leaving India; second, the route by
which they travelled to Europe; and third, the cause of their
persecution after their arrival in England from the
continent.</p>
<p>My gipsy paper did not give universal satisfaction to
everybody outside the congress.&nbsp; My plain matter-of-fact
statements raised the ire of a few little narrow-souled mortals,
who had not the courage to appear in their own dress, and
borrowed other people&rsquo;s clothes&mdash;<i>shooba Rye</i>,
&amp;c.&mdash;to crouch in while they fired their popguns at
me.&nbsp; Just as they were trying to swallow my papers, an
article appeared in the <i>Morning Post</i>, stating that I
&ldquo;knew more than any man in England about the
gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was more than <i>O Bongo</i>,
<i>ho</i>, <i>no t&iuml;ckno chavo</i> could stand.&nbsp; Editors
are not like most mortals, they have a perfect right to say what
they please about anybody and everybody.&nbsp; They and other
literary friends have been more than kind to the cause of the
children and my unworthy self, for which I thank them from the
bottom of my heart.&nbsp; Without their help I could not have got
along.&nbsp; I sent the following letter to the <i>Morning
Post</i>, bearing date October 11, 1882, relating to
&ldquo;<i>Shooba Rye</i>,&rdquo; <i>O Bongo</i>,
<i>h&oacute;</i>, <i>no t&iuml;ckno chavo</i>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your correspondent complains that I do not know
sufficient of the gipsies.&nbsp; My congress papers and my
&lsquo;Gipsy Life&rsquo; show that I know a little.&nbsp; It is
evident I know more than is pleasant to him, or he would not have
hastily snatched up some one else&rsquo;s badly-fitting
night-dress to sally forth with his farthing candle in hand to
put a &lsquo;sprag&rsquo; into my wheel.&nbsp; Such backward
movements <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>are too late in the day to stop the sun of civilization
and Christianity shedding its rays upon the path of the poor
gipsy child and its home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not pretend to know more than forty years everyday
practical observation and insight into the real hard facts of the
conditions of the women and children employed in the brickyards
and canal boats, and the dwellers in gipsy tents and vans can
give me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two days ago I came upon a family of gipsy
&lsquo;muggers,&rsquo; father, mother, and four children,
travelling in a cart.&nbsp; The poor little children, whose ages
ranged from four to twelve years, were stived up in a box on the
cart, which box was 5 ft. long by 2 ft. 9 in. wide by 3 ft high,
or about eleven cubic feet of space for each poor child.&nbsp;
The children were all down with a highly infectious disease,
carrying it from a village, where it had been raging, to Daventry
and Northampton.&nbsp; I gave the children some apples, but the
poor things said, &lsquo;We are all ill and cannot eat
them.&rsquo;&nbsp; None of these children could tell a
letter.&nbsp; These are facts and not fiction; inartistically
dressed, I admit, and without the flowers of poetical imagination
to adorn them.&nbsp; Knowledge gained under the circumstances in
which I have been placed, will, I think, be found nearly as
valuable in improving the condition of neglected and suffering
children as imaginative, unhealthy backwood fiction spun by the
yard under drawing-room influences and by the side of
drawing-room fires can be.&nbsp; At any rate, I have tried for
many long years in my rough way to look at the sad condition of
the women and children whose cause I have ventured to take in
hand with both eyes open, one to their faults, and the other to
their virtues; and also with a heart to feel and a hand to help,
as my letters, papers, and books will show to those who have the
patience to read them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not been content to sit upon mossy banks by the
<a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>side of
rippling rivulets, with a lovely sun shining overhead, and
beneath the witching looks and mesmeric smiles of lovely damsels,
swallowing love and other tales as gospel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is time the hard facts and lot of our gipsies and
their children&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, those travelling in vans,
shows, and tents&mdash;were realized.&nbsp; It is time we asked
ourselves the question, &lsquo;What are the vast increasing
numbers&mdash;over 30,000&mdash;of children tramping the country
being trained for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is this: Parliament, Christians, moralists,
and philanthropists have been content for generations to look at
the gipsies and other travellers of the class through glasses
tinted and prismed with the seven colours of the rainbow, handed
to us by those who would keep the children in ignorance and sin,
instead of taking them by the hand to help them out of their
degrading position.&nbsp; My plan would improve their condition,
without interfering with their liberty to any amount worth
naming, considering the blessed advantages to be derived by the
gipsies and others from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No amount of misleading sentiment will stop me till the
case of the poor children is remedied by the civilizing measures
of the country&mdash;viz., education, sanitation, and moral
precepts&mdash;extended to them by an Act of Parliament, as I
have described in other places, which could be carried out, and a
system of free education established, by means of a pass book,
without any inconvenience or cost worth mention.&nbsp; Why should
our present-day canal and gipsy children be left out in the
cold?&rdquo;</p>

252</span>Rambles Among the Gipsies at Daventry and Banbury
Fairs.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> eleventh of October, one
thousand eight hundred and eighty-two dawned upon &ldquo;Old
England&rdquo; while rain was coming down too drearily, drizzly,
and freely for either man or beast to be comfortable.&nbsp;
Foggy, cold, and murky November seemed desirous of making its
advent earlier than usual.&nbsp; Not a songster was to be seen
nor an autumnal chirp heard round our dwelling.&nbsp; Long dark
nights had begun to creep over nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;The last rose
of summer,&rdquo; the Queen of English flowers, was drooping its
head and withering up, and the leaves were dwindling down to
nothingness.&nbsp; The lanes were strewn with dying leaves which
had done their duty nobly and well.</p>
<p>Through the low and heavy clouds the voice and footsteps of
children, as they trotted off with their milk tins, seemed to
echo in my ears, and other sounds to hover round me, carrying
with them a kind of hollow sepulchral sensation, telling me that
summer was dead and autumn was preparing nature for the winter
shroud, which was undergoing the process of weaving by angelic
hands.</p>
<p>The sound of the thresher&rsquo;s flail was heard in the <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>barn,
calling out &ldquo;Clank,&rdquo; &ldquo;Clank,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Clank,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thud,&rdquo; as it struck the corn
and barn floor, causing the precious grain to fly like a shower
of small pellets against the doors.&nbsp; Not a gleam of sunshine
was to be seen.&nbsp; Summer and winter seemed during the last
fortnight to have been struggling with each other, in the
death-throes of nature for the mastery.&nbsp; Genial summer had
to give way to savage winter, and little robins piped forth the
victory.&nbsp; Everywhere seemed cold, damp, and covered with
melancholy.&nbsp; As we meditated upon the surroundings, our
carrier drove to our door with his van, into which I got, and
seated myself in one of the corners almost out of sight.&nbsp; A
patent &ldquo;four-wheeler&rdquo; of this kind I had not been
used to, and our little folks did their best to try to persuade
me not to try the experiment.&nbsp; We had not gone many yards
before eggs, boxes, whiskey bottles, butter, and onions were
handed to our carrier for carriage and safe custody to Daventry
fair.&nbsp; Fat and thin women were closely packed round
me.&nbsp; Welton is a noted village for fat women, which may be
the result of the excellent water.&nbsp; While our village
blacksmith was putting some of his handiwork into the
carrier&rsquo;s van, the scene brought vividly to my mind
Longfellow&rsquo;s poem.&nbsp; He might have seen the very
spot.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Under a spreading chestnut tree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The village smithy stands;<br />
The smith a mighty man is he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With large and sinewy hands;<br />
And the muscles of his brawny arms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are strong as iron bands.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mumbled the verse over to myself as we jogged along.&nbsp;
To have repeated or bawled it out in such &ldquo;close
quarters&rdquo; would have been worse than putting one&rsquo;s
head into a hatbox.</p>
<p>After the usual &ldquo;picking up&rdquo; and
&ldquo;calling&rdquo; we began <a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>to slowly trot off with our
load.&nbsp; We had not got far before our village dames, damsels,
and companions began to indulge more or less in the usual village
gossip and jokes.&nbsp; Big heavy old women could indulge in
sprightly conversation as freely as if they were
&ldquo;four-year-olds.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pleasantry was exchanged as
to who was to sit next to our driver, so as to keep his back
warm.&nbsp; Village parsons and squires were the first upon the
programme.&nbsp; Then came a long rigmarole about the old maids
and maidens, poachers, slovens, slatterns, fashions, Jacks, Jims,
and Pollies.&nbsp; Everybody knew everybody&rsquo;s business,
ranging from the death of Polly Jones&rsquo;s cat to Squire
Brown&rsquo;s fine horse.&nbsp; Good masters were passed over
with &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a bad sort of man to work for, and
he&rsquo;d be better if he had more to do with.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bad
masters were mentioned with a curl of the lip, a scowl and a
shake of the head, ending with &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bad &rsquo;un;
my man shouldn&rsquo;t work for him at any price, if I could help
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. So-and-So, and Miss So-and-So were
&ldquo;snappy old things,&rdquo; &ldquo;niggardly, mean, and
miserable;&rdquo; &ldquo;nobody has a moment&rsquo;s comfort near
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said one, on the road,
&ldquo;did you see Miss Jenny Starch on Sunday with her new
bonnet on?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t she look mighty fine?&nbsp;
Wasn&rsquo;t she a stuck-up thing?&nbsp; Nobody could come near
her with a fork.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you see,&rdquo; said
another, &ldquo;the three poor little children running about the
streets this morning, almost naked, in rags and dirt?&nbsp; The
mother is idle, and the father drinks.&nbsp; They both want
horsewhipping, and if I could have my own way I would give it
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;and
serve them right.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you see,&rdquo; said
another, &ldquo;the Misses So-and-So in church on Sunday?&nbsp;
They looked quite pretty.&nbsp; When you can just catch them in
the right temper, they are so nice and pleasant.&nbsp; What a
thing this money is, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Money buys fine
feathers, and fine feathers make fine <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>birds.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Anybody
can be made pretty, nowadays, if they have only the money,&rdquo;
said a stout dame, who had a big red face under a little bonnet,
and must have weighed little short of eighteen stone.&nbsp; We
were passed on the road by two &ldquo;screwy&rdquo; old maids
from Bonnybrook, &ldquo;trotting off to market&rdquo; in a green
pony carriage, sitting like Jack and Jill, one before and the
other behind, bolt upright and as still as posts, looking out of
the corner of their eyes.&nbsp; As we were mounting the hill
going into Daventry the question of &ldquo;leaving&rdquo; was
brought upon the carpet, and it came out that all of them were
satisfied with their &ldquo;old masters,&rdquo; and were going to
&ldquo;stop again at the old wages.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am afraid
their &ldquo;old masters&rdquo;&mdash;husbands&mdash;will have a
little difficulty in getting rid of them.&nbsp; They like the
&ldquo;old shop&rdquo; too well to budge.&nbsp; The process of
riddance, &ldquo;My dear husband,&rdquo; and a stream of tears
would have to be faced before they &ldquo;cleared out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had not been long in the &ldquo;mop&rdquo; before I was face
to face with a good-looking, but somewhat eccentric, and
good-natured popgun owner, named Mott, at one of the
stalls.&nbsp; One passage of Scripture after another he repeated
in rapid succession with breathless speech, until quite a crowd
gathered round us in the drizzling rain.&nbsp; After my
friend&mdash;who has been on the road attending fairs for forty
years&mdash;had finished his speech, his wife handed to him a
newspaper, out of which he read my letter as it appeared in the
<i>Daily News</i>, bearing date September 5th, 1882, which will
also be found in page 161.&nbsp; The newspaper had been given to
them by a dirty, wretched, filthy-looking family of travelling
show folks from London, whose corns and consciences had been
touched to the quick.&nbsp; After he had read it, and had given
it to his wife again, I expected a &ldquo;rather hot
reception,&rdquo; especially after a paragraph which has been
going the round of a few of the papers, to the effect that I must
look out for <a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>trouble from &ldquo;light and dark
gentlemen.&rdquo;&nbsp; As the paper passed from his hands I
looked rather anxiously into his face to see what the effect
would be.&nbsp; To my surprise, the index of his soul showed
pleasure, and not anger; and in unmistakable tones he said,
&ldquo;You are quite right, sir, and I thank you for it.&nbsp; It
is rather warm, but your object is right&mdash;there is no
mistaking that.&nbsp; I quite agree with your plans, and so does
every right-thinking man.&nbsp; The traveller&rsquo;s and other
gipsy children ought to be educated.&nbsp; God bless you, sir, I
know what religion is; I am an old backslider.&nbsp; I was once a
leading member among the Baptists, but I chipped out over a
little thing, and now me and my old woman are travelling the
country in our van, and doing this sort of thing.&nbsp; There is
one thing I should like to say, sir; I never creep into my bed in
the van without saying my prayers to my heavenly Father.&nbsp; I
feel to sleep better after it.&nbsp; It soothes me a
little.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tears were making their way down the
grey-haired traveller&rsquo;s face; and I think it would have
been a blessed thing for him if I could have introduced him into
a Methodist prayer-meeting, as a stepping stone that would lead
him out and on to the paths he trod in the days of yore, crying
out from the depths of his soul, in the language of a writer in
the <i>Christian Life</i> for October 14th, 1882&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou art a rock, to which I flee;<br />
With all my sins I come to Thee,<br />
And lay them down, Lord, at Thy feet,<br />
Before the shining mercy-seat.<br />
Thou art a fortress strong and high,<br />
To which for shelter all may fly,<br />
Sure there to find a safe retreat,<br />
Beneath the sacred mercy-seat.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After shaking hands with this couple I bade them goodbye, and
gave them something to read during the dark hours of winter,
something in which are buried seeds of a <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>bright
spring-time for them both, if they will only follow out the
directions given.&nbsp; I then strolled into the fair.&nbsp; I
had not gone far before I came upon an old brickmaker, and from
him I gleaned some facts showing how wretchedly the Brickyard Act
of 1871 is being carried out.&nbsp; After chatting with him for
some minutes he apparently took stock of my hair, which has,
thank God, grown almost white in the cause of suffering
children.&nbsp; Mr. Brickmaker turned quite poetical, and in
parting said&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Take stock, Mr. Knock,<br />
That&rsquo;s what I have to say, Mr. Grey,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and he then sidled and smiled away into the crowd.</p>
<p>I had not been long moving to and fro among the gipsies before
I learned that two gipsies, whose head-quarters were a few miles
from Daventry, were undergoing transportation, one for
sheep-stealing, and the other for horse-stealing.&nbsp; The
horse-stealing gipsy was caught in his own trap, owing to his
being too clever and daring.&nbsp; It came about as follows: A
publican and farmer a few miles from here had a fine, beautiful,
young black horse, to which the gipsy took a fancy; and it so
happened with this gipsy, as with other gipsies of this class,
that he had not too much money to spare for purchasing
purposes.&nbsp; An old idea ran fresh through his brain, which
was, that he could with but little trouble make the horse his
own, without money and the bother and trouble of giving back the
&ldquo;shilling for luck&rdquo; on the completion of the
purchase.&nbsp; Accordingly he sallied forth one dark night and
took the beautiful animal out of the field, not far from
Daventry, and kept it &ldquo;in close confinement&rdquo; for
three days to undergo doctoring, at the end of which time the
stolen horse was quite a different looking animal.&nbsp; The
horse now had a white star upon its forehead, and two white
fetlocks.&nbsp; Its tail and mane were shortened, and, with the
assistance of &ldquo;ginger,&rdquo; it put on <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>quite a
sharp, frisky appearance.&nbsp; In the meantime he heard that the
owner of the horse was much in want of one.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought the gipsy, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a fine
chance for turning money over quickly, and getting rid of an
animal that would turn &lsquo;a tell-tale&rsquo; if kept too
long.&rdquo;&nbsp; Consequently the gipsy mounted his steed, and
off he trotted to the publican.&nbsp; On arriving at the door he
called the innkeeper out to look at a horse that he had for sale,
&ldquo;good, quiet in harness, sound in wind and limb, a good
worker, without a blemish, and cheap.&rdquo;&nbsp; The publican
liked the looks of the horse very much, and he asked the gipsy to
trot him up and down the road; and off the horse bounded,
frisked, and danced about quite lively.&nbsp; The action of the
horse was all that was desirable, and the price
&ldquo;right.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the end the horse was sold, glasses
round given, the &ldquo;luck shilling&rdquo; returned, the horse
was put into the stable, and the gipsy became scarce.</p>
<p>Three days after the &ldquo;white star&rdquo; and &ldquo;white
fetlocks&rdquo; were not to be seen, and the horse began to look
&ldquo;quite different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was brought plainly home to the publican that he had bought
back his stolen horse.&nbsp; The gipsy was &ldquo;hunted
up,&rdquo; tried, and sentenced to a &ldquo;long term,&rdquo;
where horses are not to be had.</p>
<p>In the fair, or &ldquo;mop,&rdquo; there were eight vans, in
which there would be about sixteen men and women and thirty
children living and sleeping; and, so far as I could gather, only
about four could read and write, and these were adults, none of
whom were teaching their children anything that would be helpful
to them in after life.</p>
<p>Connected with one of the &ldquo;Aunt Sally&rdquo;
establishments there were man, woman, and three little neglected
children, with no other sleeping accommodation than a
&ldquo;bottom&rdquo; of straw spread under the stall, covered
with an old sheet, and warmed in the winter by an oil lamp.&nbsp;
The poor <a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>woman was the picture of poverty, despair, degradation,
and misery.&nbsp; Their stall and &ldquo;Aunt Sally&rdquo; were
pushed through the country on a small &ldquo;hand
cart.&rdquo;&nbsp; The family hailed from Leicester, and were in
a most wretched, dirty, and ignorant condition.&nbsp; As soon as
I saw the man I thought I could recognize his features as those
of a <i>posh</i> gipsy I had seen before; and it turned out to be
true, for he was no other than a &ldquo;fishman&rdquo; who had
more than once carried my fish to the station.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;mop&rdquo; I came across a man and woman with
four children who hailed from a village a few miles from
Daventry, and who had taken to gipsying and were singing in the
streets in the midst of mud and drenching rain&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Beautiful Zion, built above,<br />
Beautiful city that I love,<br />
Beautiful gates of pearly white,<br />
Beautiful temple, God its light.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three of these children were of school age, but could not read
or write a letter.</p>
<p>When I questioned the man about putting the children into the
union workhouse, and the wrong he was doing to them in bringing
them up as tramps, he said &ldquo;he could not help that; they
must look out for themselves as they got bigger, and help to do a
little for him.&rdquo;&nbsp; By singing about the streets they
got him some &ldquo;baccer and a little vittles.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
1882 at the &ldquo;mop&rdquo; I met with a showman, named
S&mdash;, and his wife and six children, living in a wretched
tumbledown van; the small windows were broken, and rags, dirt,
and filth abounded in every nook and corner.&nbsp; The father had
had a religious &ldquo;bringing-up&rdquo; by Christian parents in
Cornwall, and for many years earned a good living in Wales as a
miner, and was a member of a Christian Church.&nbsp; The sharp,
good-looking woman, although dirty and dejected enough to banish
looks and spirits to the winds, waves, and realities of eternity,
bore up fairly <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>well under the wretched surroundings.&nbsp; She had,
previous to her marriage, for many years been a
&ldquo;lady&rsquo;s maid&rdquo; in a good &ldquo;religious
family,&rdquo; and was well educated.&nbsp; The man was ingenious
and clever, and had during his spare moments and hours in Wales
made the working model of a coal-mine, which, at the instigation
of &ldquo;<i>religious friends</i>,&rdquo; he began to exhibit in
public.&nbsp; The success that attended him in the first instance
led him to think that he was on the high way to a fortune.&nbsp;
He acted upon the advice of his &ldquo;<i>Christian
friend</i>&rdquo; and others, instead of his own common sense,
and bought a van in which to place his handiwork, and &ldquo;took
to the road.&rdquo;&nbsp; A downhill one for himself and his
large family it has been ever since, and they are now gipsying,
and cursing the day upon which he took and followed the advice of
a shortsighted&mdash;to say the least&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Christian
friend</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In giving advice, God-fearing Christian men and women above
all others should look well ahead, and to all the surroundings of
the case, before deciding the fate of a family.&nbsp; Advising a
parent to break up a settled home and comfortable livelihood to
tramp the country among gipsy vagabonds and tramps, I consider
little less than murder.</p>
<p>In making their way one Sunday from a village to attend the
&ldquo;mop,&rdquo; they got stuck fast at the bottom of a hill
with an old bony emaciated horse that would not draw &ldquo;a
man&rsquo;s hat off his head.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor little
children dressed in dirt and rags, and scarcely able to toddle,
had to set to work to drag and carry the old boards, rags, and
other things belonging to their &ldquo;show&rdquo; to the top of
the hill.&nbsp; After hours of toil, interrupted by the constant
striking and chiming of church bells on the bright autumn Sunday
morning, they were able to make another move.</p>
<p>Their show consisted of the working model of the mine, <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>one of
their youngest children, nearly naked, with a Scotch plaid over
its shoulder being exhibited as a &ldquo;prize baby.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In addition it included a boxing establishment.&nbsp; The man had
not the build and stamina to lead the &ldquo;ring,&rdquo; and
they had to wait for the &ldquo;millers&rdquo; to pair themselves
before a boxing exhibition could take place.</p>
<p>They had not been in Daventry long before this backsliding
showman, who had taken to gipsying, was wanted by
<i>Sh&oacute;rokno g&aacute;iro Gar&eacute;ngro</i> for cruelty
to his horses.&nbsp; The result was that he had to &ldquo;do a
month&rdquo; in Northampton gaol.&nbsp; No doubt the poor
misguided showman would feel in his cell as John Harris puts
it&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here bees and beetles buzz about my ears<br
/>
Like crackling coals, and frogs strut up and down<br />
Like hissing cinders: wasps and waterflies<br />
Scorch deep like melting mineral.&nbsp; Murther! save!<br />
What shall a sinner do?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which I would have answered&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Pray to
thy God<br />
To help thee in thy trouble.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A week or two after I saw the woman and her six children in a
most destitute condition.&nbsp; I gave the poor little things a
good tea and cake in my house, and subscribed my mite towards
buying them another horse, and advised them to make their way to
Aberdare, in Wales, and take to mining again, to send their
children to school, for none of them could tell a letter, and
they were growing up worse than heathens.</p>
<p>Their first venture at a showman&rsquo;s life was to exhibit
the model and paintings, and they hired a donkey-cart and set off
to Aberdare.&nbsp; When they got there the showman wrote to me,
&ldquo;I am sure you would have been amused if you had been there
to have seen us; for <a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>when we had our establishment
erected&mdash;which, by the way, was very small&mdash;we were too
shy at first to make an appearance outside; at last we made a
resolution, and began to shout.&nbsp; So we found out after we
had broken the ice that we were landed.&nbsp; On the first night
we took enough to pay our month&rsquo;s rent.&nbsp; This gave us
encouragement.&nbsp; We made a good many friends, and I became
notorious among my fellow workmen.&nbsp; They thought me an
extraordinary man.&nbsp; In three years I painted in oil colours
thirteen pictures, three feet square, of the interior of a
coal-mine and different other subjects. . . .&nbsp; The waxwork
show owners we had accompanied left Wales for London.&nbsp;
Afterwards my wife went to Bristol and bought a barrel organ, and
I had what we thought a very nice little show, and a nice van and
horse.&nbsp; But alas! we did not know what travelling in the
winter meant.&nbsp; We found very soon that we could not show
every night on account of the weather, and also found that we
could not get any credit.&nbsp; If we had no money there was no
bread.&nbsp; I shall never forget the first night we got
&lsquo;hard up.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dear sir, just fancy yourself going
into a large town about eight o&rsquo;clock at night, and the
rain coming down in torrents in the cold January month; the
houses shining with wet, and a horse to be fed and
stabled&mdash;for we kept it in a stable then&mdash;and six
children to get a supper for, let alone yourself, and not a penny
in your pocket, and not a friend in the world to speak to or to
give you counsel.&nbsp; Well, that is just how we were situated
in the first January that we travelled.&nbsp; Dear sir, perhaps
you would say, &lsquo;Why did you not make for your
home?&rsquo;&nbsp; That would have been the wisest plan, but we
thought we would endure anything rather than go back to be
laughed at.&nbsp; Well, after my good wife had had a good cry, we
went to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s and pledged my watch, thinking
that we should be able to redeem it again in a few weeks.&nbsp;
We borrowed <a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>fifteen shillings, so that with opening the show we
could be helped on for a few weeks, instead of which we met with
a worse misfortune than ever.&nbsp; We lost our horse at
Pontypool.&nbsp; We pledged our organ for &pound;2, and then
trailed our van to Swansea for Llanefni fair, thinking we should
get money enough to buy another.&nbsp; More next week.&nbsp; The
children all send their love to you, wishing you a merry
Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This man was at one time earning nearly &pound;2 per week, and
had a good home.&nbsp; It will be found on close inquiry that
nearly all our present-day showmen have been in better
circumstances, and rather than be laughed at for their silly
adventures by their friends, they are content to wander up and
down the world little better than vagabonds, and to train their
children for a tramp&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; By travelling in vans,
carts, and tents they escape the school boards, sanitary
officers, rent and rate collectors; and to-day they
are&mdash;unthinkingly, no doubt&mdash;undermining all our social
privileges, civil rights, and religious advantages, and will, if
encouraged by us, bring decay to the roots.&nbsp; I speak that
which I do know, from what I have seen and heard.</p>
<p>I had heard of a gipsy Smith who had settled down, and was now
residing in one of the &ldquo;courts&rdquo; of Daventry.&nbsp; I
hunted him up, and found him in a little cottage residing by
himself.&nbsp; The cottage was nice and clean.&nbsp; When I went
in I was invited to sit upon a chair.&nbsp; The old gipsy had
just come home with some work.&nbsp; He was lighting the fire,
and I said to him, &ldquo;I suppose you could do very well with a
<i>Hotchi-witchi</i> just now, could you not, Mr.
Smith?&rdquo;&nbsp; The old man turned up his bronzed face, and
with a laugh said, &ldquo;I just could, my dear good
gentleman.&nbsp; I was looking for one this morning, but could
not find one.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Could you do with a
<i>Kan&eacute;ngro</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; The old man replied,
&ldquo;I could if I had one; but I never goes after them
now.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t <a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>much care for them.&nbsp; I would
rather have <i>Hotchi-witchi</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a general
conversation for a few minutes, I said, &ldquo;How long have you
given up travelling?&rdquo;&nbsp; He replied, &ldquo;Nearly
thirty years.&nbsp; I like it better now.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How
long have you lived by yourself?&rdquo;&nbsp; The old man&rsquo;s
lips began to pucker and tears came into his eyes.&nbsp; After
wiping his face, he said falteringly, &ldquo;It is nearly four
years since I lost my dear good bedfellow.&nbsp; We had lived
together over forty years.&nbsp; She was a good creature, and I
mean to meet her in heaven, bless the Lord.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been
a bad one in my time, but I&rsquo;ve given up all bad ways, and
have attended the Wesleyan chapel and the Salvation Army nearly
two years, bless the Lord; it was the best day&rsquo;s work that
ever I did when I found Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old gipsy now gave
me a little of his history.&nbsp; &ldquo;My grandfather was a
Welsh gipsy, and used to attend Northampton and Daventry market
and fairs with horses and ponies, and in course of time my father
and grandfather began to travel round the midland counties and
the Staffordshire Potteries.&nbsp; I was born under the hedge in
Gayton Lane, between Kingsthorpe and Boughton Green.&nbsp; The
gipsy&rsquo;s lot is a hard one, I can assure you, my good
gentleman.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen a deal in my time.&nbsp; I
attended Boughton Green fair for thirty years, and for eighteen
years of this time in succession I never knew two of my cousins
to leave the fair without fighting.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen murder
upon the &lsquo;Green&rsquo; more than once.&nbsp; It will never
be known in this world how many murders have been committed upon
the &lsquo;Green.&rsquo;&nbsp; There has been some fearful
bloodshed and rows done, I can assure you.&nbsp; The gipsies are
very vengeful and spiteful, if they ever take it in their heads
to be so.&nbsp; Two of my cousins, D&mdash; and N&mdash;,
quarrelled, when they were children down &lsquo;Spectacle
Lane,&rsquo; over a few sticks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They parted, and never met each other again for twenty
years, and then it was at a Boughton Green fair.&nbsp; When <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>the fair
was over they went into a field to have their old grievance out
in blows.&nbsp; They had not been fighting long before D&mdash;
was put senseless upon the ground.&nbsp; N&mdash; went to his
tent, and after a few minutes I followed him, and said to my
cousin, &lsquo;N&mdash;, you have killed D&mdash;; you had better
be off.&rsquo;&nbsp; He went then and there, and has never been
took.&nbsp; We buried my cousin, and the day I shall never
forget.&nbsp; It was a day, I can assure you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know where my cousin is now, but I have seen him lots of times
since then.&nbsp; The past is a blank, but I mean to get to
heaven to meet my dear good old creature.&nbsp; I wish I could
read; what a great pity it is that none of us poor gipsies can
read.&nbsp; Bless the Lord, although I cannot read I prize the
Bible, God&rsquo;s book; it&rsquo;s the best book in the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old man now took down a small pocket
Bible off his kitchen shelf, and clasped it to his breast and
said, &ldquo;Although I cannot read I puts it in my chair when I
says my prayers, and the dear Lord blesses it to my soul and
makes me feel happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After partaking of a cup of tea and a slice of bread and
butter in the humble &ldquo;British Workman&rdquo; in High
Street, I made my way to the Byfield carrier, Mr. W&mdash;, to
secure my &ldquo;berth&rdquo; in his cart, which was pretty
closely packed with groceries, servants&rsquo; boxes and trunks,
nails, balms, and paraffin, &ldquo;chaps,&rdquo; girls, and their
mothers.&nbsp; There seemed to be no &ldquo;cousins&rdquo; in our
party.&nbsp; I was pretty well wet through from head to foot, and
it was perhaps fortunate that we were closely packed, as by which
means I was, in all probability, prevented taking a severe
cold.&nbsp; At a jog-trot rate we began to move out of Daventry
at the heels of a grey horse, whose sides stuck out with fatness
and with a &ldquo;coat&rdquo; as sleek as a mole.&nbsp; Mr.
W&mdash; looked well to his steed, while Mrs. W&mdash; chatted,
joked, and chaffed with her company inside.&nbsp; Up hills and
down dales lay our course.&nbsp; Parsons and squires, as usual,
were <a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>the
theme, in the first instance, for conversation and gossip.&nbsp;
The Rev. Mr. So-and-So was a very good man in the pulpit but a
bad one out of it, and a worse landlord.&nbsp; And they began to
enumerate cases of hardship inflicted by him.&nbsp; I must
confess that I should not like to be a clergyman with a large
family in a small poor parish with a small stipend, and with
&ldquo;charity money&rdquo; to deal out to a number of
dissatisfied, idle, grumbling poor people.&nbsp; A clergyman
nowadays has to mix up with the grand and fashionable, to visit
the poor, dispense charity with smiles, write any number of
letters for the parishioners, assist the sexton, take a lead in
the choir, preach his own sermons, superintend the bell-ringers,
keep the parish accounts, blow up the roadmen, visit &ldquo;new
comers,&rdquo; allay scandal, hush gossip, settle squabbles, be
liberal, stand insults, know everybody&rsquo;s business, and know
nobody&rsquo;s business.&nbsp; Must not pay too much attention to
young ladies for fear of trouble at home.&nbsp; He must be
handsome, lovely, and charming, with a rich melodious voice; hide
the faults of evil-doers occupying big pews, lecture evil-doers
in little pews; never enter a &ldquo;dissenting&rdquo; chapel,
give Methodists the &ldquo;cold shoulder&rdquo; privately,
fraternize with them publicly; take wine with the rich, be
teetotal among the poor; give the &ldquo;tip-top&rdquo; price for
his goods; and above all things, and under all circumstances, the
parson must never look cross.&nbsp; If at any time he feels angry
he must &ldquo;keep it to himself inwardly and never show
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are the qualifications for a minister of
the gospel according to the ideas and motives of Church dwarfs
and Sunday saints.</p>
<p>Parsons were now dispensed with, and darkness was creeping
over us as we passed by Sir Charles Knightly, Baronet&rsquo;s,
beautiful estate at Fawsly.&nbsp; The next leading topic of our
dames and damsels was, as might be expected, the appearance of
certain ladies at the usual maidenhood <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>ages.&nbsp;
We had not gone far before I knew most of the ages of the
&ldquo;young&rdquo; dames in the cart, who were much surprised to
find that I was younger than they were.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lor bless
me!&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;there is no accounting for looks
nowadays, for I was talking to a lady the other day, and telling
her how young she looked, and that I wished I had as good a black
head of hair as she had; but lor and behold you, when I went home
with her, I found out that the black hair was a wig, and her own
hair was as white as mine.&nbsp; I never was more astonished and
surprised in all my life.&nbsp; I could not help but stare at
her, she did not look like the same woman, Mrs. W&mdash;; I
should not have known her if I had not known her so well, and
what had made the change.&nbsp; Since then I have guessed but
little at women&rsquo;s ages.&rdquo;&nbsp; We now pulled up to
allow one or two of our party to get out.&nbsp; Our legs had been
so crushed and mixed up with each other&rsquo;s that we were
almost left in doubt as to whose legs we were standing upon, Mrs.
W&mdash; na&iuml;vely remarking, as the young damsels were
stepping down, &ldquo;Now mind and see that you got out upon your
own legs; don&rsquo;t run away with some one
else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were now seated, and off we began to jog again.&nbsp; We
had not got far before the company began to ask each other if
they were &ldquo;saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; The word &ldquo;saved&rdquo;
is a word well known to me from childhood, and at its sound I
pricked up my ears, and began to ask questions about it.&nbsp;
And the answers I received were as follows: &ldquo;Why, bless
you, dear sir, have you not heard of the great stir that has been
going on among the children connected with the Methodist and
Congregational chapels in Byfield?&nbsp; We are woke up at eleven
o&rsquo;clock at night by the children singing about the streets
Moody and Sankey&rsquo;s and Salvation hymns&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Only an armour-bearer, firmly I
stand,<br />
Waiting to follow at the King&rsquo;s command,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;I love to tell the story<br />
Of unseen things above,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who are these beside the chilly wave,<br />
Just on the borders of the silent grave?&rsquo;
&amp;c.&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and away they go all round the village disturbing
everybody.&nbsp; The young things ought to be in bed.&nbsp; The
girls have got so excited that they go about shouting and singing
in the daytime.&nbsp; One girl I knew went into the garden to get
some cabbages, and while she was getting them up, the devil came
to her, and told her that she was not &lsquo;saved,&rsquo; and
the girl knelt down in the middle of the garden at dinner-time,
and there and then began to pray, cry, sing, and shout.&nbsp;
After a time she jumped up and said she was saved.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the girl, &lsquo;Master Devil, I am
saved.&rsquo;&nbsp; Another girl went into the garden to get some
potatoes, and the good, or some other spirit, came to her, and
said that unless she was saved all the potatoes in the garden
would go rotten.&nbsp; She there and then stuck the fork into the
ground, and began to pray to God to save her.&nbsp; She had not
prayed long before she got up and shouted out, &lsquo;I am saved!
bless the Lord!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked how all this was brought about, and the answer I got
was, that &ldquo;The children began to sing in the streets some
hymns, and to hold children&rsquo;s prayer-meetings, under the
direction of nobody but themselves; and the movement began to
spread about, and bigger folks attended the meetings, and now the
place is almost in an uproar; everybody is asking each other, or
nearly so, if they are saved.&rdquo;&mdash;I kept putting in a
word for the children, bless their little
hearts!&mdash;&ldquo;Tea-meetings and prayer-meetings are held,
the chapels are filled, and it is all through the children.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t like so much shouting and going on in this
way.&rdquo;&nbsp; I hope the good work is still going on,
notwithstanding the old woman&rsquo;s cold water.</p>
<p><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>It
was now pitch dark, and we were winding our way down the narrow
lanes in Byfield to the carrier&rsquo;s home, with whom and his
good wife I was to stay for the night, where we arrived
&ldquo;safe and sound,&rdquo; but cold and damp.</p>
<p>On the hearth there were six beautiful cats, named after her
husband&rsquo;s friends.&nbsp; A month before this they had eight
cats; and Mrs. W&mdash; says next year she hopes to keep a
dozen.&nbsp; The big-hearted, genial woman is an ardent admirer
of animals.&nbsp; She said she never had but one valentine in her
life, inside of which were pictures of cats, dogs, rabbits, and
birds; and it was addressed to her as &ldquo;Mrs. W&mdash;, Cat
and Dog Fancier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a good warming and an excellent supper, &ldquo;the good
woman of the house,&rdquo; Mrs. W&mdash;, began to tell me a
little of their family history, while her good husband was seeing
to his horses, which were petted like children.&nbsp; My hostess
related her story as follows: &ldquo;My father lived to be
ninety-four years of age, and my mother died last August at the
age of ninety-two.&nbsp; I have had fifteen brothers and sisters,
all of whom are dead but three.&nbsp; I have not been out of
mourning for sixteen years.&rdquo;&nbsp; She now fetched the
photographs, walking-sticks, and other things of her parents, for
me to look at, and then continued her sorrowful story.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;was a great sufferer
for some years, but she bore it all so meekly.&nbsp; She never
murmured once during her illness, and was always talking about
heaven.&nbsp; Once she said to me, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
kiss your father?&nbsp; He is in the room and wants to shake
hands with you; why don&rsquo;t you kiss him?&rsquo;&nbsp; Just
before she died she called me to her and said, &lsquo;I am going
to die, my child.&nbsp; I am going to your father.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And then she said, faintly, &lsquo;&ldquo;Come unto Me, all ye
that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will never leave thee nor forsake
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; My girl, trust in Jesus.&nbsp; Come a little
nearer to me.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she then whispered in <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>my ear,
&lsquo;Meet me in heaven,&rsquo; and passed away like a child
going to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What is this that steals upon my frame?<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it death?&nbsp; Is it
death?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tears were now forcing their way down the good woman&rsquo;s
face, and in the midst of sobs and sighs a tremulousness was
manifest, and she quietly stole upstairs to pray, and to ask
Jesus to dry her tears.</p>
<p>After she had left me I was upon the hearthstone alone.&nbsp;
The ring-dove, nineteen years old, perched in its cage by the
fireside, began to &ldquo;coo&mdash;coo&mdash;coo;&rdquo; the
cats began to &ldquo;pur&mdash;pur&mdash;pur;&rdquo; the dog to
snore; the kettle to sing; and the lamp shed a cheerful light
upon the whole.&nbsp; I stole away to rest my weary bones upon a
snowy-white feather bed, and under an extra lot of blankets and
fine linen sheets.&nbsp; How different, I thought, as I wandered
into dreamland, from the lot of the poor gipsy child, whose
sheets are old rags, and whose feathers are damp and almost
rotten straw, with mother earth for a bedstead, and the canopy of
heaven for curtains.</p>
<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock I turned out and got my breakfast, and
with the morning dawn and a lovely sun shining in my face, I took
a stroll through the ancient village to stare at the loitering
villagers, gaze at the thatched roofs, eye over the tradesmen, to
peep at a very ancient, curious, antiquated stone upon the green,
which the roots of a huge tree were toppling over, enjoy the
feast of some beautiful scenery, and make some inquiries about
the empty house pleasantly situated in the village.&nbsp; I paid
my bill&mdash;two shillings&mdash;and gave the little servant and
mine hostess some picture-cards and little books, and then seated
myself in the carrier&rsquo;s cart to be drawn round the village
before we trotted off to Banbury fair.&nbsp; Out in the way, the
nurse-girls, mothers, and children shrieked out with laughter as
<a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>they
tossed upon their knees the round-faced, chubby, live, kicking,
squeaking balls of love, embodiments of pleasure and trouble,
singing and shouting&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ride a cock-horse to Banbury Cross,<br />
To see a fine lady get on a white horse,<br />
With rings on her fingers and bells on her toes,<br />
And she shall have music wherever she goes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the way and in carts there were crowds of human beings,
pretty and plain, big and little, tall and thin, short and stout,
some dressed in silks and black cloth, some in rags and tatters;
some were smiling all over their faces, and others looked as
cross and sour as if they lived on nothing but vinegar and crabs
and slept on thorns and thistles.&nbsp; Lovers and haters,
pleasure-seekers and thieves, labourers, farmers, tradesmen, and
gentlemen, were hurrying helter-skelter to Banbury fair.&nbsp;
Some were crying, some were laughing, some were shouting,
roaring, puffing, and panting; others were in carriages, with
liveried servants as attendants; some were on horseback and
donkeyback; others were in horse-carts, donkey-carts, and
waggons; and among the number there was a little thin man of
sixty winters, standing about two feet six high with his boots
on, and by his side was his wife, about five feet high, stout,
plump, and about thirty years old.&nbsp; I should not be
surprised to hear that she had &ldquo;not agreed to stop
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was well able to carry him on her back,
as gipsies do their children, instead of which she looked down
upon him and allowed him to trudge along in the mud and
rain.&nbsp; She had no love for the little fellow, or she would
have carried him in her arms; in fact, she seemed inclined to
walk on the other side of the road.</p>
<p>In the throng and crush we arrived at Banbury.&nbsp; I paid my
fare&mdash;all the way from Daventry, one shilling and
sixpence&mdash;shook hands with my kind friends, and made <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>my way into
the crowd of sightseers, gipsies, mendicants, tramps, the
fashionable, and the gay.</p>
<p>The first gipsy I met with was an old friend, &ldquo;Righteous
Smith&rdquo;&mdash;which name was printed on the van&mdash;and
his large family, at a cocoa-nut establishment.&nbsp; One of the
daughters, dressed in lively colours, was in charge of the balls,
and shouting out to the &ldquo;chaps&rdquo; as they passed
forward, &ldquo;Try your luck, gentlemen!&rdquo; and the father
shouted out, &ldquo;Now, gentlemen, bowl away! all bad nuts
returned.&rdquo;&nbsp; In response to their bewitching entreaties
some old cricketers tried their hand, and, much to the chagrin of
&ldquo;Righteous Smith,&rdquo; they sent the nuts &ldquo;spinning
away&rdquo; rather more freely than was profitable and pleasant
for &ldquo;Righteous,&rdquo; to the extent of putting his good
name in the shade.&nbsp; This family of gipsies have, I should
think, about three parts of Romany blood in their veins.&nbsp;
Their van was a good one, and beautifully clean, and will pass
muster when the new order of things comes about, for which I am
working night and day, and which, I am thankful to say, is
casting its shadows before it.&nbsp; The eight cocoa-nut
establishments were owned by cross-bred Romanies, and one or two
of the families lived in vans fairly clean.&nbsp; There were over
thirty families living in the vans attending the fair, in which
there would be an average of three children, one man, and one
woman in each van.&nbsp; In five of the vans there were two men
and two women in each.&nbsp; A number of those who owned small
short shooting galleries and &ldquo;rock stalls&rdquo; slept with
their children under the stalls.</p>
<p>From this cocoa-nut going &ldquo;concern&rdquo; I strolled
among the shows, bosh, nonsense, and cheap Jacks.&nbsp; The
introduction to one of the sparring establishments was by an old
woman screaming out, &ldquo;We are just going to
begin.&rdquo;&nbsp; By her side was a dandily dressed and painted
doll, setting herself off to the best advantage.&nbsp; On some
steps <a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>between the two women there stood a man painted as a
fool, and dressed in tight indecent sparring costume.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Darkey,&rdquo; with his pug nose, short hair, low narrow
forehead, high cheekbones, deep sunken eyes, glistening fire like
a black glass bead in the centre of a white china button under
the glare of a lamp, which he frequently turned sharply, quickly,
and inquisitively to me as if anxious to know my movements.&nbsp;
If he had been an uncaught thief, and conscience was telling him
that I was a detective, he could not have eyed me over more
quickly and closely than he did.</p>
<p><i>Gentlemen</i> with diamond rings, poachers, and blackguards
formed the company.&nbsp; A ring was formed, and
&ldquo;Darkey&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Johnny Straw&rdquo; set to work
with their gloves &ldquo;milling&rdquo; each other, and just as
their &ldquo;savage&rdquo; was getting up, the curtain to
outsiders was drawn.&nbsp; How long the big and little fools kept
at the &ldquo;milling&rdquo; process I did not stay to see.&nbsp;
What fools there are passing through the world as gentlemen, to
be sure, to witness such debasing exhibitions with &ldquo;pure
frolic&rdquo; and laughter, while their money is being drawn out
of their pocket imperceptibly by idle vagabonds.</p>
<p>Not far from this &ldquo;boxing establishment&rdquo; there was
another &ldquo;set-out&rdquo; waiting for a second dose of fools,
with a &ldquo;champion boxer&rdquo; as a
&ldquo;draw.&rdquo;&nbsp; Money went freely into the coffers,
while the owners of stalls upon which useful articles were
exposed for sale &ldquo;had a bad time of it;&rdquo; even the
celebrated &ldquo;Banbury cake&rdquo; was &ldquo;a drug in the
market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the door, as a sign at one of the shows belonging to Mr.
Great Frederick Little, where a nude man was exhibiting
himself&mdash;&ldquo;girls and ladies not allowed to
enter&rdquo;&mdash;stood two calves&rsquo; heads over a skeleton,
and what surprised me most was that the good Banbury folks and
country Johnnies could not see the satire that was being <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>played upon
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Calves and bones&rdquo; for a sign; and I
think, judging from the dejected appearance of the people as they
came out of the establishment, they felt like &ldquo;calves and
bones&rdquo; themselves; at any rate they did not look any the
wiser&mdash;certainly they looked sadder.</p>
<p>Turning from this concern, I was jostled into a crowd of folks
to witness a man named Turnover Snuff, Esq., dressed in best blue
cloth, with gold watches, guards, and rings, making fools of two
well-dressed innocent youths, whom he had called up from the
crowd and dressed in rags to eat buns for a prize, to be used as
a &ldquo;draw,&rdquo; to enable him to pass off his showy goods
under various colours, dodges, and pretexts.&nbsp; While the
youths were forcing the buns down their throats he was cracking
jokes, which the people, with their mouths open, swallowed as
gospel.&nbsp; What this &ldquo;Cheap Jack&rdquo; said in action,
if not in words, was, &ldquo;Now, ladies and gentlemen, you see
that these two youths have come up here at my bidding, to make
fools of themselves, and to eat these buns I am forcing down
their throats, to cause you to twitter and laugh with your eyes
shut to the things that are to follow; so in like manner I want
all of you to shut your eyes and open your mouths to receive all
the lies I want to force down your throats, that I may extract
the coin from your pockets for my &lsquo;Cheap Jack&rsquo;
articles; so we will now proceed to business, ladies and
gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were one or two exhibitions in the fair of a good
genuine character, and the rest were &ldquo;rubbish,&rdquo; of
which it might be said of the performers, as a writer in the
<i>Sword and Trowel</i> for 1876 says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;See, I am as black as night;<br />
See, I am darkness, dark as hell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the fair I ran against the sanitary and local canal boat
inspector&mdash;Mr. Daniel Dixon&mdash;whom I asked to give me
his independent views of the gipsies and show-people <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>attending
the fair.&nbsp; In company with the medical officer of health he
visited the vans, and the following particulars may be taken as a
fair sample and average of the thirty vans in the fair, in
accordance with what he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to promise, I forward you the particulars of
our visits to the shows and vans visiting our fair on Thursday;
and I also took a little more trouble to be along early on Friday
morning.&nbsp; I was certainly astonished to see the people turn
out of some of these places, some of the smaller vans turning out
the greatest number.&nbsp; I give you a few instances of the
number who turned out of the smaller vans.&nbsp; In Nos. 1, 2, 6,
13, and 19 there were 5 men, 5 women, and 22 children, making a
total of 32 in the 5 vans.&nbsp; Education totally
neglected.&nbsp; They were dirty, neglected, and uncared
for.&nbsp; One van was as clean as could be expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1879, 40 vans visited our fair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1880, 50 vans visited our fair, in which there were
38 men, 32 women, and 43 children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1881 there were 130 persons in 36 vans.&nbsp; While
some of the vans were remarkably clean and well fitted up, there
were some totally unfit for habitation, and certainly ought not
to be allowed.&nbsp; The gipsy tribe was fairly represented, and
evidently some of them are fairly blest with an amount of
property which surprises me.&nbsp; There were a few surly people
who did not like our visit, and gave us unmistakable signs of
displeasure, but the majority were civil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can devise a plan whereby these people can
receive <i>any</i> education, you will render valuable service,
morally and religiously, to society at large.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After referring to the value of the Canal Boats Act, and the
amendments I propose, Mr. Dixon said that he should be pleased to
further my efforts at any time.</p>
<p>A minister of the town writes me to say that a number <a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>of vans
left the town on Thursday night or early on Friday morning.&nbsp;
In the 15 vans he visited he found 48 children and 22 men and
women, only six of whom could read and write a little.&nbsp; The
rest were growing up as ignorant as heathen, and with the
exception of two of the vans, dirt and wretchedness abounded in
their <i>homes</i>.&nbsp; He said also that the conduct of the
gipsies and other travellers at this fair has been better than in
former years.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the reports that have been in circulation,
enough to shake the nerves of timid folks, I am received kindly
and civilly by all the gipsies.&nbsp; One gipsy woman named Smith
in a jocular term said, &ldquo;Mr. Smith, we have been told that
you are going to take all our children away from us and send them
to school; you will require a mighty big school, bigger than any
in the world, to hold them, I can assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few yards from where we were standing there was a van, into
which I was invited to tea by the poor woman, the &ldquo;mistress
of the <i>house</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this wooden tumble-down
house upon wheels, about 9 ft. long by 5 ft. wide, and 6 ft.
high, there were man, wife, and seven children in a most dirty
and heartrending condition.&nbsp; The youngest was a baby only
three weeks old, and was born in the van at Weedon.</p>
<p>I had a long chat with the good-natured woman.&nbsp; As I sat
upon an old sack at the bottom of the van, with the children in
rags and dirt creeping round me, and in the midst of an odour not
at all pleasant to the olfactory organs, I felt as if my heart
was almost ready to break at the sight of human woe and misery
before me.&nbsp; To say that I could have wept hot briny tears
would not convey in language telling enough the strong feeling of
sympathy that crept over me, to the extent of almost freezing the
blood in my veins.&nbsp; For a moment I seemed to lose sight of
everything else in the fair, and it was with some difficulty <a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>I could
refrain from crying out, as I stepped from amongst the poor
little forgotten and neglected children, and out of this gipsy
house, with a cocoa-nut which &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; would thrust
into my bag, &ldquo;Good Lord! when shall these sad things and
these wretched and pitiable sights come to an end?&nbsp; Would to
God that the trumpet which is to bring to life the dead would
begin to ring! ring! ring! and thrill into our ears a nervous,
disquieting solo, keeping on and on till it has awoke us all
up&mdash;aye! ministers, philanthropists, Christians of every
grade, moralists, members of Parliament, cabinet ministers, and
peers&mdash;to a sense of our duty towards the little and big
heathens at our own door, before our fate becomes as that of
Belshazzar and Babylon.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh say, in all the bleak expanse<br />
Is there a spot to win your glance<br />
So bright, so dark as this?<br />
A hopeless faith, a homeless race.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<i>Lyrics of
Palestine</i>,&rdquo; <i>Religious Tract Society</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I answer, No.</p>
<p>No children in lovely, beautiful England, the bright star of
the West, stand so much in need of help as do our poor canal and
gipsy children, who are living outside our factory, educational,
and sanitary laws, and, with some bright exceptions, religious
influences.</p>

278</span>Short Excursions and Rambles in the Bypaths of
Gipsydom.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> time ago a gipsy named Shaw
was found in a Northamptonshire churchyard at midnight, asleep
between the gravestones, with his fiddle by his side.&nbsp; When
awakened by a wandering policeman crying out, &ldquo;Now then,
move on,&rdquo; gipsy Shaw grunted and growled out,
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&nbsp; What do you want, Mr.
Devil?&nbsp; Wake these others up; they&rsquo;ve been here longer
than me, and when they goes I&rsquo;ll go, and not till then, Mr.
Devil; and so make yourself scarce.&rdquo;&nbsp; The policeman
saw, and in fact knew, that Shaw was a queer kind of customer,
and he therefore let him snore and sleep among dead men&rsquo;s
bones till morning.&nbsp; On the following morning Mr. Policeman
met gipsy Shaw with his fiddle (<i>Boshomengro</i>) under his
arm, when he called out, &ldquo;Halloo, Shaw, you&rsquo;ve left
your companions behind you after all.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said gipsy Shaw; &ldquo;when I opened my eyes
it was daylight, and the sun was shining in my face, and I
thought over fresh considerations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the present time the gipsies and other travellers in this
country are among the dead men&rsquo;s bones of backwood gipsy
writers and their present-day sins and wrong-doings, <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>with Mr.
John Bull standing by, saying in effect to the lost gipsies and
their children, &ldquo;Snore on, sleep on; stick to your fiddles
and the devil; care not a straw for either parsons or
priests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If John Bull cares not, will not and won&rsquo;t do for the
children of travellers the same as he is doing for other children
within his dominions, and what his Continental neighbours are
doing for theirs, it is time the gipsies themselves
&ldquo;thought over fresh considerations,&rdquo; and walked out
into open day, and demanded the blessings of English civilized
life in a way that will readily secure an attentive ear to the
cries and wails of their children.</p>
<p>Thank God, a few writers of tales and stories of a healthy,
interesting, elevating, and heavenly kind are coming to the
rescue of the poor gipsy, canal, and other travelling
children.&nbsp; May their name be Legion and their motto be
Fairelie Thornton&rsquo;s lines in the <i>Sunday School
Chronicle</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Direct the words I say,<br />
Oh, let them reach the heart;<br />
Let there be wing&egrave;d words alway,<br />
And light and life impart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On my way to Edinburgh in October, 1880, to read a paper
before the Social Science Congress, upon the condition of our
gipsies and their children, I took occasion to call at Leicester
races on my way, and paddled ankle deep in mud and quagmire to
try to ascertain how many gipsy and other travelling children
there were upon the course living in tents and vans.&nbsp; At a
rough calculation there would be fully four hundred children and
two hundred men and women huddling together in eighty of these
wretched temporary abodes.&nbsp; Not a score of the children,
except a few snatches in the winter, were receiving any education
other than such as is obtained upon a racecourse and its
associations, giving and taking lessons <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>in the
initiatory stage of a gambler&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; The following
cases will give some idea of the state of morality amongst the
wandering classes.&nbsp; Phillips, a gipsy from Maidstone, had in
his van one woman and eleven children; Green, a gipsy from
Bristol, had in his van two men, two women, and eleven children;
Brinklow, a gipsy, had in his van two women and seven children;
Lee, a gipsy from London, had in his tent two young men, one
woman, and seven children; making a total of forty-seven men,
women, and children of all ages and sizes, huddling together in
these four tents and vans, not two of whom could read or write a
sentence.&nbsp; Mrs. Brinklow said her eldest girl attended a
Bible-class at Bristol in the winter, which led me to think that
the gipsy girl could read, but on inquiry I found she could not
tell a letter.&nbsp; Those who are spellbound by gipsy
fascination and admire the &ldquo;witching eyes&rdquo; of
picturesque human degradation and depravity, will consider this
in the nineteenth century a state of civilization preparing us
for the millennium, when the lion shall lie down with the lamb,
and all tears be wiped away.</p>
<p>Last autumn I visited the gipsies at Cherry Island, near
London, and found about thirty tents, in which there were between
one and two hundred gipsy children growing up worse than
Zulus.&nbsp; For one minute let us get inside one of the gipsy
tents in which these children are born, and in which they live
and die.&nbsp; It is about seven feet wide, sixteen feet long,
and where the round top is highest, is about four feet and a half
in height.&nbsp; It is covered with pieces of old canvas or
sacking to keep out the cold and rain, and the entrance is closed
with a kind of curtain; the fire by which they cook their meals
is placed in a tin bucket pierced with holes.&nbsp; Some of the
smoke from the burning sticks goes out of an opening in the top
of the tent that serves as a chimney, while the rest of it fills
the place and helps to keep their faces and hands a proper <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>gipsy
colour.&nbsp; The bed is a little straw laid on the damp ground,
covered with a sack or sheet, as the case may be; an old soap-box
or tea-chest serves both as cupboard and table.&nbsp; Here they
live, father and mother, brothers and sisters, huddled up
together.&nbsp; They live like pigs, and die like dogs.&nbsp;
Washing is but little known amongst them; and of such luxuries as
knives and forks, chairs and tables, plates and cups, they are
very independent.&nbsp; They take their meals, and do what work
they do, squatting on the ground; and the knives and forks they
use are of the kind that Adam used, and sensitive when dipped in
hot water.&nbsp; Lying, begging, and pretended fortune-telling
have as much to do with their living as chair-mending, tinkering,
and hawking.&nbsp; The heaviest work falls to the lot of the
women, who may often be seen with a child upon their backs,
another in their arms, and a heavily-laden basket by their
side.&nbsp; The men lounge about the lanes and hedges with their
dogs, whilst the children grow up in such ignorance and sin as to
deserve the name of <i>ditch-dwelling heathens</i>.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The winter drives many of the gipsies to encamp in the
marshes, or in the disused brickfields near London.&nbsp;
Anything more dismal and wretched than this life it is hard to
think of.&nbsp; All the poetry of gipsying is clean gone then,
and nothing is left but filth, poverty, vice, and misery.&nbsp;
In Hackney Marshes and elsewhere about London you may find scores
of these tents, often so rotten that a stiff wind would blow them
away.&nbsp; Creeping into one of them, almost on all fours, you
find half-naked gipsy children squatting upon the ground, busy at
skewer-cutting, for which they get from tenpence to one shilling
for fourteen pounds&rsquo; weight.&nbsp; Or else the family is at
work in the more elaborate processes of making
clothes-pegs.&nbsp; One chops sticks the right length; another
trims them into shape and flings them into a pan of hot water; a
child picks out <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>the floating pieces and bites off the bark; and then a
bigger lad fastens the two together with a strip of tin, and the
clothes-peg is ready.&nbsp; So the dreary day goes by until the
lurcher dog springs up, the unfailing attendant of the gipsy man,
and the women of the family return with the scraps they have
picked up in questionable ways at back doors, and with the
proceeds of their sales.&nbsp; At night all lie down where they
have worked, and sleep as they are, with but a rag between them
and the bleak night of pitiless rain and snow.&nbsp; Here the
gipsy children are born and brought up.&nbsp; Here they live and
here they die, almost as far away from the track of any
day-school or Sunday-school as if they were African savages.</p>
<p>The poor wandering outcast gipsy child can say with Phineas
Fletcher in the &ldquo;Fuller Worthies&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;See, Lord, see, I am dead;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomb&rsquo;d in myself, myself my grave:<br />
A drudge, so born, so bred,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Myself, even to myself, a slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask&rsquo;st Thou no beauty but to cleanse and clothe
me?<br />
If, then, Thou lik&rsquo;st, put forth Thy hand and take
me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two years ago I attended a village feast in the neighbourhood
of Bedford, and found, as usual, a large gathering of gipsies and
others of a similar class plying their avocation among the
&ldquo;knock&rsquo;em downs,&rdquo; &ldquo;three shies a
penny,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; On arriving at the place I found
&ldquo;a gipsy row upon the carpet,&rdquo; and on going up to one
of the gipsies to ask him what it was all about, a gipsy some
fifty yards off, more like a madman than anything else, began to
bawl out all sorts of hard things, and in doing so other gipsies
began to cluster round us, and to all appearance I seemed to be
in a fair way for being in the midst of a &ldquo;Welsh
fight.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I said to the gipsy who was standing by
me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to see what he wants.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you do,&rdquo; the gipsy <a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>replied, &ldquo;he will knock you
down.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Then I will go to be knocked
down,&rdquo; and away I went, and while I was going along the mad
gipsy was literally foaming with rage, and uttering oaths and
curses on my head not quite as thick as hailstones.&nbsp; On
arriving before his majesty I began to smile at him, and said as
I put out my hand to him, &ldquo;Will you shake
hands?&rdquo;&nbsp; At this he drew back a little, and said,
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Lend me your
hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; He again said, with more emphasis than before,
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ultimately he put out his
hand into mine, and the result was nothing would please him and
the other gipsies but that we must drink some ginger-beer
together.&nbsp; And while this was going on a gipsy from Barking
Road, London, whom I had seen before, whispered in his ear who I
was, and that I was trying to get their children educated.&nbsp;
So nothing would serve them but to explain in a public-house bar
how the education of the gipsy children was to be brought about,
which plan seemed to please them amazingly; and at the end of my
tale they again closed in upon me, but this time to thank and
bless me.&nbsp; The foremost in doing so was the mad gipsy whom I
faced in the storm, saying, as he shook hands with both hands in
a rough fashion, &ldquo;I do love you, that I do, for taking so
much trouble over our children.&rdquo;&nbsp; After similar
greetings from the others we parted.&nbsp; Only one out of the
large number of gipsies there could read and write, and he had
taken to gipsying from the boarding-school at the age of
seventeen, and, sad to say, neither his wife nor one of their
eight children could tell a letter; and he further said that he
was sure there was not one gipsy in a hundred who could read a
sentence.&nbsp; To the gipsies I would say with a writer in
<i>Hand and Heart</i>, Ah!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mistaken mortals, did you know<br />
Where joy, heart&rsquo;s ease, and comforts grow!&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>In
May, 1880, I visited one of the largest towns in the midland
counties, with the object of ascertaining the probable number of
shows, vans, and other movable abodes there were in and round the
outskirts of the town, and found close about thirty.&nbsp; These,
together with others in various parts of the country, would in
all probability bring the number to nearly forty-five.&nbsp; No
doubt other counties would furnish similar results.&nbsp; In
showing the number of those who live in these vans I will quote
the following seven cases as a specimen.&nbsp; The numbers were
given to me by a man and his wife, who own and live in one of the
vans about the size of a carrier&rsquo;s dray, following the
profession of &ldquo;knock-&rsquo;em-down.&rdquo;&nbsp; B&mdash;,
man, wife, and eleven children of all ages and sizes; S&mdash;,
man, wife, and four children; J&mdash;, man, wife, and five
children; P&mdash;, man, wife, and seven children; B&mdash;, man,
wife, and four children; E&mdash;, man, wife, and seven children;
N&mdash;, man, wife, and five children.&nbsp; By these figures it
will be seen that there are forty-three children and fourteen men
and women, with four-fifths at least of English blood in their
veins, living in these seven vans.&nbsp; Few of these persons can
read or write.&nbsp; I should think scarcely half a dozen could
write their own names.&nbsp; In the case of the man B&mdash;, two
children could just put three letters together, and two could
just write their own names, and this was the extent of their
education.&nbsp; Some of the &ldquo;popgun&rdquo; owners I have
known personally for some years.&nbsp; One of the sons worked for
me, and would by this time have been earning his &pound;1 per
week; but instead of this the whole family of twelve have taken
to this libertine kind of wandering existence, with a prospect
that does not look very encouraging, and many others are doing
the same thing.&nbsp; These cases are given to show what is going
on all over the country.&nbsp; In some instances the parents
would send their children to school, <a name="page285"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>but they say they cannot afford to
pay for a week&rsquo;s schooling when the children can only
attend a day or two.&nbsp; It seems hardly fair to make those who
of all others should have their education encouraged to pay three
times as much as town residents, which is the case when the
children attend three different schools in one week.&nbsp; These
ramblers are on the increase, and it is high time they were taken
in hand.&nbsp; James, a man well known, and who travels with a
&ldquo;ginger-bread stall,&rdquo; said, when I told him my object
and what the results would be, as he filled my hand full of his
best &ldquo;Grantham ginger-bread,&rdquo; &ldquo;God bless you,
man, for it, and I wish with all my heart it would come to pass
to morrow.&nbsp; Will it be three months first?&rdquo;&nbsp; I
told him that I thought it would be a much longer time than that,
at which he shook his head, and said it was a &ldquo;bad
job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gipsies of England have nothing in the past to thank us
for, except the policeman&rsquo;s cudgel and the &ldquo;wheel of
fortune&rdquo; in the big &ldquo;stone jug.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one
has taken them by the hand to lift and lead them out from among
the dead men&rsquo;s bones and demoralizing scenes in the midst
of which they have been content with hellish delight to
revel.&nbsp; Thank God, a few kind-hearted friends are beginning
to notice them in their degraded condition, and to write to me on
the subject.&nbsp; One of the leading woollen manufacturers of
Scotland wrote to me in 1881 as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear
Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can testify to the horrible social state of the van
population at described in your occasional communications to the
<i>Times</i>.&nbsp; This class of people overflow in Scotland,
and for some years I have had occasion to observe their habits
and habitations.&nbsp; But hitherto no persons in authority seem
to take any interest in the matter, though it is one of grave
social importance.&nbsp; We have visits of people who live in
vans, who bring to the town such entertainments as shooting
galleries, hobby horses, and any kind of trumpery
exhibitions.&nbsp; These <a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>concerns are made up of families who
pig together in their vans in a state which defies decency or
sanitary rules.&nbsp; Whole families house in these small boxes
upon wheels, usually in size about eight or nine feet by five
feet.&nbsp; One lady recently tried to converse with some
children of this class, and found they were ignorant of
everything that was good.&nbsp; A gentleman interviewed one of
the male heads of one family or group.&nbsp; He said his wife had
had seventeen children, all born in the van in different counties
of England.&nbsp; Within a few yards of my own door a van just
lately stood for a night, in which slept one woman and five men
or lads.&nbsp; The man&mdash;if he were the father&mdash;said
they dealt in horses, and belonged to Hull, and they travelled
the country living in their van, which was about eight feet by
five feet.&nbsp; What I complain of is that, while local
residents are made subject to various rules, educational and
social, police, and sanitary order, these people should escape
all kinds of supervision, and be literally a law unto
themselves.&nbsp; I can well understand the strong reasons you
have for calling public attention to such an evil.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Rev. John L. Gardiner, vicar of Sevenoaks, wrote me in
1880 stating the guardians in his place were thinking of moving
the authorities to take some steps for ameliorating their
condition.&nbsp; In 1880 I received the following letter from a
right worthy, good, and true working man living in Derby:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear
Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt not but that you will feel surprised at
receiving a letter from me, an entire stranger to you; but I feel
certain that the subject which I wish to bring before you will be
a sufficient apology for my intrusion on your valuable
time.&nbsp; I have very recently seen in the public journals
allusions to another appeal from you on behalf of our poor gipsy
and van children, whom you are striving to reclaim from a life of
utter ignorance, and I wish you a hearty Godspeed in your noble
endeavours.&nbsp; I doubt not, if it could be ascertained, there
are thousands of these poor children in our land of boasted
Christianity growing up in ignorance and crime, and enduring the
greatest amount of misery that we could imagine.&nbsp; I have no
doubt but that a large percentage of our worst criminals emanate
from this class of poor children.&nbsp; When I think of these
poor outcasts, and think that they are my brothers and sisters,
made by the same Divine hand and bearing His own image, and for
whom Christ died that they should be raised up to Him, I feel my
heart burn within me, and I often pray to God that He would raise
up some one able to plead their cause.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>Early
in 1880 a lady at Sherborne, Dorset, wrote me as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have always taken a deep interest in
them.&nbsp; I have again and again wished that I could help to
make them more intelligent and useful, for they are not a stupid
race.&nbsp; About two months since a poor young woman of this
class called at my house with a beautiful infant almost
naked.&nbsp; I relieved her, and inquired the whereabouts of
their encampments, which was about one and a half miles distant
from my home.&nbsp; I went over to see them, and I assure you my
heart yearned to do something to help to sweeten the atmosphere
of their moral life.&nbsp; There were youths and maidens,
children, old women and old men; but alas!&nbsp; I was powerless
to do anything for them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A clergyman of high standing, near Salisbury, wrote me in 1880
to say that a committee of the Salisbury Diocesan Synod had
commissioned him to collect information bearing on the neglected
condition of the population accustomed for the greater part of
the year to live in caravans and attend fairs in the
diocese.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could,&rdquo; continued the worthy
clergyman, &ldquo;bring before you many proofs of the wretchedly
ignorant and degraded condition of the class I am speaking of,
which have come under my own personal notice; but I know I am
writing to one better informed on the subject than any
one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later on the Canon wrote me stating that the
clerk of the market in Salisbury had told him that the stray
population imported into the town as traders, showmen, &amp;c.,
for an autumn fair amounted to about five hundred, and the fair
was by no means a large one.</p>
<p>Last year a clergyman at Tavistock wrote me as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear
Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your letter in yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Western Morning
News</i> respecting the education of the canal boat children
reminds me of the question of the education of gipsy children, in
which subject I believe you take a very active interest.&nbsp; I
occasionally visit the gipsy tents and vans when they come into
this neighbourhood, and find that a great many of these people
admit that they cannot read, and others say they can <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>read a
little; but I fear that the great majority of the gipsy
population are quite unable to read, and have very hazy ideas on
the great principles of religion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems quite a reproach to the English nation to
allow these wandering people to continue in its midst without
some efforts towards Christianizing them.&nbsp; Although the
subject is no doubt a difficult one, it would not seem
impracticable to get these gipsy children to attend school at
certain centres for portions of the year.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know what has been done in the matter, but I wish you every
success in your efforts for attaining this object, as well as for
obtaining the efficient carrying out of the Canal Boats
Act.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1881 a leading and active county magistrate of Danbury,
Essex, wrote me as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear
Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I observe that you say in your recent letter to the
Secretary of the Lord&rsquo;s Day Observance Society, that the
&lsquo;extension of the principle of the <i>Canal Boats Act</i>
to all <i>gipsy tents</i>, <i>vans</i>, and other movable or
<i>temporary dwellings</i>, should be brought about by all
means.&rsquo;&nbsp; I should he extremely pleased to aid in this
work, for we reside near Danbury Common, where all the worst
features of the vagrant life may be certainly seen.&nbsp; Numbers
of little ones are daily passing before us untaught, and
suffering in health through exposure to cold and wet, versed in
arts of deception and quite inaccessible to influence.&nbsp;
During the severe weather lately we had several ruffianly fellows
on the common who defied interference with the most lawless
proceedings.&nbsp; They went about in gangs breaking up gates and
fences, and committing thefts and depredations all around the
common.&nbsp; Any ordinary police force is quite inadequate to
check or control them when a few reckless men chance to come
together.&nbsp; They carried away and broke up two pates from a
farm of mine on the other side of the common, and several
occupiers on that side suffered severely from their
violence.&nbsp; But all this is really of little importance
compared with the question of <i>the children&rsquo;s</i>
condition of ignorance and general ill-being.&nbsp; I am sure
that those who dwelt <i>under tents</i> must have perished or
laid the foundation of fatal disease during the late severe
weather.&nbsp; It is clearly against public policy that parents
should be allowed thus to trifle with the health of their
children; and of course the same objection applies to their want
of education.&nbsp; There are gradations of well (or ill) being
among these poor wandering folks, as you no doubt are well
aware.&nbsp; Some are in comfortable vans, and earn an honest
livelihood by some handicraft&mdash;tinkering, <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>basket-making; but those who possess scarcely anything
but the tent that covers them are in a miserable plight in deep
snow or in wet weather, and young children are placed in
peril.&nbsp; I will not weary you by enlarging on this topic,
which must, moreover, be sadly familiar to you.&nbsp; I desired
to assure you, as I now do, that I will do anything in my power
to extend the legislation which you have already had the
happiness of effecting to those poor outcasts who may doubtless
through England be reckoned by thousands.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Early in the present year a Scotch Presbyterian clergyman at
Aberfeldy wrote me to say that he had been deeply impressed for
some time by the necessity there was for the State to take in
hand the gipsy and similar travellers, and had last year got the
Presbyterians of Breadalbane to petition Parliament to take some
action in the way of improving the condition of the gipsies.</p>
<p>J. T. Pierce, Esq., J.P., county magistrate of Essex, writes
me again under date October 2, 1882:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Can you oblige me by forwarding a copy of
the Bill amending your Act, 40 and 41 Vict. c. 60?&nbsp; I am
desirous of bringing the question of <i>registration of vans</i>,
&amp;c., before my fellow magistrates at our next quarter
sessions.&nbsp; The children who dwell in small vans and <i>under
tents</i> cannot receive education under the present state of
things, and it is seldom any of them are got into industrial
schools.&nbsp; Possibly the magistrates of different counties
might help forward the extension of your scheme in favour of
these poor children.&nbsp; There is a common here on which we get
a large number of them every year, and I have had a fair
opportunity of seeing how urgent is the need of legislation,
unless the children are to remain in their present state of
ignorance and dirt.&nbsp; No thoughtful man can desire this, and
you have already done so much in this direction that every one
who thinks about it must wish to strengthen your hands for
further work.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The foregoing independent statements, given by persons I have
never seen, extracted out of shoals of letters I have received,
will faintly show what is going on all over the country among our
English heathens and hell trainers; while sensual, backwood,
romantic gipsy novelists have been drawing a film over our
eyes.</p>
<p>I have received a number of suggestions as to how the <a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>gipsy
problem should be solved.&nbsp; A Scotch Presbyterian minister
suggests that the children should be sent to an industrial
reformatory; in fact, he would obliterate them with an iron hand
from the face of the earth.&nbsp; He goes on to say that the
recent School Act is useless for them in Scotland.&nbsp; They can
and do with ease evade all its requirements.</p>
<p>One kind-hearted lady, who writes to me from Brentwood, thinks
that separate schools should be built for the gipsy and other
travelling children.&nbsp; Neither of these suggestions are
practicable and workable: the former is too severe for English
liberty, and the latter too wild and scattered; and it would also
be too costly, and in the end it would prove a failure.</p>
<p>On October 25, 1882, I sent Mr. Mundella copies of my Social
Science Congress papers, with the hope of eliciting something
from him as to what steps the Government proposed taking in the
matter, and the following is his reply:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Privy Council Office</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Whitehall</span>,<br />
<i>October</i> 26, 1882.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am much obliged to you for the copies of the papers
read by you in the Health Department of the Social Science
Congress on the Canal Boats Act and on the gipsy children, and I
will give the same my careful attention.&nbsp; I shall be very
thankful if anything can be done to remedy the evils affecting
the neglected children referred to in your papers, and to whose
interest you have given such long and faithful service.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;I am, dear sir,<br />
Yours faithfully,<br />
A. J. <span class="smcap">Mundella</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>George Smith</i>, <i>Esq.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have thought since I took up the canal crusade in 1872, as
my letters will show, and I cannot for the life of me do
otherwise than think so now, that the Canal Boats Act Amending
Bill I am humbly promoting could be <a name="page291"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>made to include all movable
habitations and temporary dwellings.&nbsp; The counsel to the
Education Department, Mr. Ilbert, thought otherwise, and of
course I have had to submit to the &ldquo;ruling of the
chair.&rdquo;&nbsp; He thought that a separate Act would better
meet the case of the gipsy and other travelling children.&nbsp; I
am not now alone in my idea of including all movable dwellings in
my Canal Amending Bill; for since I mooted the subject in my
letters to the press and in other ways, friends have come round
to see that there is something in the suggestion worthy of
notice.&nbsp; Canal-boat cabins and vans are boxes in which are
stived up human beings of all ages and sizes, without either
regard for health, morals, sense or decency, packed closer than
the poor unfortunate creatures in the black hole of Calcutta
were.&nbsp; These moving homes are drawn, in many instances, by
animals with only one step between them and the blood- or
foxhound&rsquo;s teeth.&nbsp; The only difference is, one home is
moving through the country upon our magnificent, black, streaky
canals, of the enormous width of about twenty feet, and an
average of three feet deep.&nbsp; For the size of boats and boat
cabins and other particulars I must refer my readers to my works,
&ldquo;Our Canal Population,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Canal Adventures
by Moonlight,&rdquo; and for the full particulars of gipsy tents,
vans, &amp;c., to my &ldquo;Gipsy Life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last Essex Michaelmas Quarter Sessions, with Sir H. Selwin
Ibbetson, Bart., M.P., in the chair, was supported by between
forty and fifty leading county magistrates.&nbsp; The following
is taken from the <i>Chelmsford Chronicle</i>, October 20,
1882:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Canal Act Amendment
Bill</span>.&mdash;Mr. Pierce suggested that this Bill should be
referred to the Parliamentary Committee, with a view to their
considering whether clauses should not be recommended to
Parliament to be added for dealing with gipsy and travelling
show-man life as well as canal life.&nbsp; Mr. Pierce spoke of
the miserable <a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>squalor and unwholesome condition in which the gipsies
and travelling showmen lived, and said he thought it was
necessary that their children, who are absolutely uneducated, and
who number about 30,000, should be looked after.&nbsp; Seconded
by Mr. G. A. Lowndes.&nbsp; This motion was carried.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a leading article upon the subject the <i>Chronicle</i>
stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An excellent suggestion was made to the
court by Mr. Pierce.&nbsp; It was that they should refer the
Canal Boats Act Amending Bill to the Parliamentary Committee,
with a view to their recommending to Parliament the addition of
clauses bringing nomadic life&mdash;like that of the gipsy and
showman fraternity&mdash;within the scope of the measure.&nbsp;
Of gipsy life we have some experience in Essex, and we know that
it stands in sad need of regulation.&nbsp; Mr. Pierce stated,
<i>inter alia</i>, and on the authority of Mr. George Smith, of
Coalville, that there are about 30,000 children belonging to
gipsies and travelling showpeople, most of whom are being brought
up wholly without education.&nbsp; It is no less a duty to
society than to the children themselves that this state of things
should be put an end to, for we cannot hope to banish the ruder
kinds of crime, such as the vagrant classes are commonly guilty
of, without first banishing ignorance.&nbsp; In this view we hope
that other public bodies will follow the example, and that the
promoters of the Bill about to be brought forward will be induced
to extend it so as to embrace the gipsy and kindled
classes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In July, 1880, Mr. Joseph Cowen very kindly put a question to
Mr. Dodson, the President of the Local Government Board, relating
to the education of gipsy and other travelling children, and the
sanitary arrangements of their homes, and Mr. Dodson replied,
&ldquo;There is considerable difficulty in dealing with gipsy
tents and vans, but the matter has been brought under the notice
of the Board, who will endeavour to deal with it when a suitable
opportunity presents itself for that purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Government had their hands pretty full last
year&mdash;Ireland and the Irish at the beginning, Ireland and
the Irish in the middle, and Ireland and the Irish at the
end&mdash;nearly altogether Irish, which no one grudges to make
our Brothers and Sisters on the Emerald Isle contented,
prosperous, <a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>and happy.&nbsp; God grant that her noble sons and
daughters may go ahead, and her &ldquo;Moonlighters&rdquo; be
swallowed up in the greater light that rules the day.&nbsp; This
being so, I kept myself pretty well occupied in piloting,
altering, and man&oelig;uvring my Canal Amending Bill through its
initiatory stages, and had no time to deal with the gipsy problem
other than to try &ldquo;at every turn and twist&rdquo; to find a
niche, nook, or a peg in the Bill upon which to hang the gipsy
question, which to me did not, and does not even now, seem at all
a difficult thing to do.&nbsp; The more I go into the details of
the canal and gipsy question the simpler they become.&nbsp; All
that is required, as in the case of the brickyard children, is to
take hold of them and to begin to deal with them in a business
fashion, as other questions are dealt with.</p>
<p>The subject is studded with prickles, but immediately it is
grasped the prickles become harmless.&nbsp; In the distance they
look like drawn glistening daggers, which, as you approach nearer
to them, are no more dreadful than rushes in the meadow.&nbsp;
Unearth the Guy Fawkes gipsy monster, and we shall soon find out
a way to deal with gipsy vagabonds and to reclaim their
children.&nbsp; Standing by whimpering, sobbing, and sorrowing
over the children will not pull them out of the gutter; nor will
covering them with backwood gipsy nonsense and trash make them
white.&nbsp; The gipsies and their children are dark and down,
and to whiten and raise them the law and the gospel must come in:
first, the law, schoolmaster, and sanitary officer; and second,
the Christian minister and the gospel.</p>
<p>In bygone days, under the reign of Elizabeth and the Georges,
the hangman&rsquo;s hemp and the whipper&rsquo;s thong were used
as a cure for the gipsy social evil, but with worse than no
results.&nbsp; Recently, in Hungary, measures of another kind
were adopted to compel the gipsies to make themselves
scarce.&nbsp; Innumerable complaints had <a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>at times
reached the chief of the police from the townsfolk of Szegedin,
in Lower Hungary, with whose portable chattels and goods the
gipsies persisted in making free.&nbsp; The police official was
sorely perplexed how to deal with the wandering
ragamuffins.&nbsp; The gipsies in Hungary, as well as in other
parts of the world, have masses of hair&mdash;our present race of
English gipsies cannot boast of the raven black hair as
formerly&mdash;so the chief of the police conceived the idea of
barbering their pates of all their locks.&nbsp; The gipsies were
taken into custody and the town barbers were summoned to clear
the heads of the swarthy gipsies of their present
adornments.&nbsp; The orders were obeyed to the letter,
regardless of either sex or age.&nbsp; In a few minutes the whole
tribe with pates as smooth as an ostrich&rsquo;s egg were
conveyed to the town gates in a state of indescribable
discomfiture.&nbsp; I &ldquo;guess,&rdquo; as Jonathan says, they
will not for a long time visit Szegedin again.&nbsp; There is a
wide difference between the Hungarian authorities and the
Nottingham town authorities.&nbsp; Not being able to attend the
recent Nottingham goose fair, I wrote to the town clerk and the
chief constable for a few particulars, relating to the condition
of the vast numbers of poor neglected gipsy and other travelling
children who attended the borough fair.&nbsp; The town clerk
deigned not to descend from his high pinnacle to order a reply to
my letter.&nbsp; The chief constable, after some days had passed
over, said he would send me some facts, which, though I reminded
him of his promise more than once, are not yet to hand.&nbsp;
Gipsy children may live and gipsy children may die, but these
officials, I suppose, think that they shall go on for ever, and
in the end, as a writer in <i>The Christian Age</i> says, they
will</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Rest where soft
shadows lie and grasses wave;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>at least they hope so.&nbsp; Full particulars of the hardships
<a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>and
cruelties practised upon the gipsies for their wrongdoing will be
found in my &ldquo;Gipsy Life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing full well as I do that nothing but salutary measures
of the kind I propose, and have proposed for many long years,
will meet the case, I had again the audacity to put the question
to the Government, through Mr. Burt, with the object of eliciting
from them the steps&mdash;if any&mdash;they proposed taking this
Session for dealing with the gipsy problem.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span

</blockquote>
<p>The questions and answers are taken from the <i>Times</i>,

the leading papers throughout the country.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span

Government Board if the Government intend taking any steps early

vans, and places of the kind, under the influence of the sanitary
officers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Dodson, the President, said he would &ldquo;consider
whether the law as it stood was in need of amendment in this
respect; but he could not, on this any more than on any other
subject, now give any undertaking as to the introduction of a
Bill next session.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span

any steps early next session for bringing about the education of
gipsy and other travelling children living in vans, carts, shows,
and other temporary dwellings.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Mundella said: &ldquo;It is exceedingly difficult to
devise any effectual scheme for the education of the nomadic
population referred to in the question of my hon. friend, and up
to the present we have received no suggestion for dealing with
the subject which appears to be practical.&nbsp; The matter,
however, is &lsquo;under consideration,&rsquo; and we propose
during the recess to confer with the Local Government Board
respecting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Burt wrote to me as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Smith</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will see from the <i>Times</i> to-day the answers
given by Mr. Dodson and Mr. Mundella.&nbsp; They are not so
encouraging as one would like, though it may do good to call
attention to the subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Very truly yours,<br />
<span class="smcap">Thomas Burt</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Parliament having been opened February 15, 1883, I began to
make a move towards getting my Canal Boats Act Amendment Bill
before the House of Commons for the third time&mdash;last year it
was introduced to the House of Lords by Earl Stanhope&mdash;and
lost no time in seeing my friends Mr. Burt and others upon the
subject, some of whose names are upon the back of the Bill.&nbsp;
The names upon the Bill are as follows: Mr. Burt, Mr. S. Morley,
Mr. John Corbett, Mr. Pell, and Mr. Broadhurst.&nbsp; Feeling
anxious, and seeing no difficulty in the matter, I wrote to Mr.
Burt on March 3, 1883, about introducing a clause in the Bill to
include gipsy and other travelling children&mdash;my plans for
improving the condition of the canal children and gipsy children
being identically the same in <i>every </i><a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
297</span><i>particular</i> so far as the provisions of the Act
are concerned&mdash;and he replied as under:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">House of Commons</span>,<br />
<i>March</i> 8, 1883.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Smith</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want a new clause or any alteration in the Bill,
kindly write it out on a copy of the Bill and forward it to
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen Sir Charles Dilke, and he advises me to
talk the matter over with Mr. Hibbert.&nbsp; I shall do so as
soon as I can see Mr. Hibbert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go to Newcastle to-morrow, returning on Monday night
or Tuesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not hopeful that the Government will do anything
in the present state of business.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Yours truly,<br />
<span class="smcap">Thomas Burt</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I added the following clause to the Bill, and at the same time
I gave under the Bill more power to the Education Department than
I had done in the previous Bills.</p>
<p>The new clause affecting gipsy children runs thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;11.&nbsp; The expressions &lsquo;Canal
Boats,&rsquo; &lsquo;Canal Boat,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Boat,&rsquo;
in the principal Act and this Act, and also in the regulations of
the Local Government Board and Education Department, shall
include all travelling and temporary dwellings not rated for the
relief of the poor.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I forwarded copies of the Amended Bill to Sir Charles Dilke,
the new President of the Local Government Board, and also to Mr.
Mundella, the Vice President of the Committee of Council on
Education, and here are their replies.&nbsp; A few days
previously I had written to Sir Charles Dilke and Mr. Mundella,
urging them to take up the Bill; in fact, I have for years been
pressing the Government to take up the Bill, as one that will do
much good and bring them much credit.&nbsp; Of course I cannot
expect them to do impossibilities.&nbsp; I know their hands are
full; at the same time the period has come when the sixty
thousand canal and <a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>gipsy children must be educated and cared for by
&ldquo;hook or by crook,&rdquo; as being of primary importance
for the country&rsquo;s welfare to the thousand and one things
that are now before Parliament.</p>

<p>My days of hard work, and scores of letters written in
relation to the questions put to Mr. Dodson and Mr. Mundella,
have brought forth the usual molehill of &ldquo;under
consideration.&rdquo;&nbsp; The political fields of moral and
social progress are full of crotchets and molehills.&nbsp; Would
to God that either John Bull with his horns or John Straw with
his spade would level them to the ground.</p>
<p>At any rate those mountainous molehills, six inches high,
which are checking the van of social progress, laden as it
is&mdash;aye, heaped up&mdash;with blessings for the thirty
thousand poor little gipsy children who are starving to death in
our midst, in the mud, rotten straw, filth, and rags of a
soul-perishing and body-killing nature, amidst which the poor
gipsy child has to live.</p>
<p>The greatest difficulties I know of are the dung heaps
scattered about by sensational trash backwood gipsy <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>writers.&nbsp; I can almost imagine our imported and
other Demetriuses and damsels calling out on the steps of St.
Stephen&rsquo;s, Westminster, &ldquo;Sirs, ye know that by this
craft we have our wealth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Paul hath persuaded
and turned away much people.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Our craft is in
danger to be set at nought.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us hang the
devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The registration official overcomes &ldquo;difficulties&rdquo;
when he registers a gipsy hawker&rsquo;s van in order that he may
extract &pound;4 from him; and the policeman overcomes
&ldquo;difficulties&rdquo; when he brings to bay before a bench
of magistrates a gipsy child for stealing a turnip, or a gipsy
poacher for making too free with a partridge.&nbsp; There are
seas of &ldquo;difficulties&rdquo; to be waded through, it would
seem, before the gipsy children are to be led to the school
doors, and the sanitary inspectors to their suffocating, immoral,
and unhealthy homes.&nbsp; It is un-English, wicked, and unjust
to deliver the gipsy and other travelling children over to the
policeman, without ever having taught them to know right from
wrong in day and Sunday schools.&nbsp; A terrible day of
reckoning and vengeance awaits us for our wrongdoings towards our
present-day English gipsy children, think about it as lightly as
we may.</p>
<p>The sanitary inspector steps into lodging-houses to prevent
overcrowding.&nbsp; The factory inspector steps, without an
invitation, into the workshop to prohibit the overworking of
children.&nbsp; The Board of Trade officer will not allow
overcrowding of ships, although they may be classed as A1 at
Lloyd&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Overcrowding in barracks and workhouses is
not allowed, and the School Board officer steps into a
labourer&rsquo;s household&mdash;the head of which, with a large
family surrounding him, only earns about 12s. per
week&mdash;under pain of a fine and the
&ldquo;squire&rsquo;s&rdquo; displeasure, and orders the young
urchins off &ldquo;neck and crop&rdquo; to school; while canal
and gipsy children are left out in the cold.</p>
<p>Two years ago I invited twelve gipsy children, who were <a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>living in
two vans and attending our feast, to tea on our
hearthstone.&nbsp; Although three of the parents could read and
write, and ten of the children were of school age, not one of the
poor little things could tell a letter.&nbsp; All the
van-dwellers were in the lowest depths of degradation, filth, and
misery.&nbsp; They were surrounded with sunshine, and yet it
never entered their wretched dwelling; at any rate they never
opened their door with glad hearts and thankful song to receive
its cheering rays.</p>
<p>The chimes and music of church bells seemed to have no other
effect upon their lives than the bringing forth of the cries of
misery, wails of anguish, and groans of despair.&nbsp; The
beautiful robes with which nature was clothed made their ragged,
wretched torn garments look as if they had been pulled to pieces,
torn and stuck together by demons who had thrown off all moral
restraint, and were following the downward tendencies of human
nature to their hearts&rsquo; content.&nbsp; Three of the parents
once had a comfortable settled home, but alas! alas! it seems to
be all over, and a blacker future for the children awaits them,
if the Government do not take the poor things by the hand and
lead them a step forwards and upwards.</p>
<p>At the close of 1882 I visited, on a Sunday afternoon, a camp
of gipsies upon Turnham Green.&nbsp; There were five vans and
tents, and fourteen men and women and seventeen children
squatting round their fires upon the wet and slushy grass.&nbsp;
As I neared them, five of the gipsy children, half naked, came
running towards me.&nbsp; One little curly-headed fellow, named
Boswell, shouted out, &ldquo;If you please, guv&rsquo;-nor, have
you come to teach us to read, the same as a kind lady did last
summer?&nbsp; We wish you would.&nbsp; Have you brought us any
picture books?&nbsp; Please read a bit to us.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
a few minutes chat with them, I emptied my bag of cards, and with
a sorrowful heart left the gipsy children in their ignorance to
speed their wishes into the air, so it <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>appears.&nbsp; With a writer in the <i>Sunday
Magazine</i>, I say with a deep, deep-drawn sigh&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh the wandering waifs and strays,<br />
In hiding day and night,<br />
And lacking verdant shelter,<br />
On their lives a blight;<br />
Aye, creeping far and farther<br />
From the eyes of men;<br />
If they find a lodging,<br />
&rsquo;Tis in some horrid den!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little later on I went to Daventry and found a man&mdash;a
tradesman&mdash;in the market-place, exhibiting a deformed pony
rather than follow his own trade.&nbsp; Both man and wife could
read and write&mdash;in fact, the woman had once been a
Sunday-school teacher&mdash;but not one of their five children
could read a sentence.</p>
<p>Only the other day, our good vicar&rsquo;s respected wife,
Mrs. Darnell, in company with her niece, Miss Stansfeld, took
shelter in a cottage, rather than face two most repulsive-looking
men and one woman with seven children, who were tramping the
country in a most wretched and forlorn condition.&nbsp; Their
only home consisted in an old handcart full of rags, upon which
were perched, on a most bitterly cold and wet day, three poor
gipsy children; and the other four children were trudging by the
side of the hand-cart scarcely able to get one foot before the
other.&nbsp; Their shoeless footprints seemed to cry out loud for
help.&nbsp; Many gipsies camp upon Cannock Chase from time to
time, and such is their character that people passing that way in
dark hours generally take the precaution to be armed with
pistols, and to have dogs by their sides.</p>
<p>Think about it lightly as we may, the evils of gipsying are on
the increase in this country.&nbsp; Fortune-telling and deceit
are taking fast hold upon the &ldquo;silly girls and young
chaps.&rdquo;&nbsp; Very recently the <i>Daily News</i> reported
a case in Dorsetshire where two gipsy women induced a <a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>dairyman&rsquo;s wife to part with her sovereigns for a
sheep&rsquo;s heart studded with pins in mystic patterns outside,
and crammed inside with bright farthings.&nbsp; The heart was to
be hung in the chimney till Easter, when it was to be taken out
and all the farthings to be turned into sovereigns.&nbsp; The
woman&rsquo;s husband broke the &ldquo;spell&rdquo; by pulling
the heart out of the chimney before Easter.&nbsp; The
<i>Graphic</i>, in the spring of 1882, reports a case of a
&ldquo;white witch&rdquo; at Plymouth, who declared that the
whole crew of a smack were under a &ldquo;spell&rdquo;&mdash;and
the crew believed it&mdash;which &ldquo;spell&rdquo; only the
gipsy witch could remove, and of course for money only.&nbsp; The
<i>British Workman</i> for October, 1882, shows a little of some
of the evils of fortune-telling.&nbsp; At the Bradford county
police-court recently, Delia Young, a gipsy, was charged with
fortune-telling.&nbsp; For some weeks the prisoner, with a number
of other gipsies, had been staying at a village named Wyke, and
hundreds of persons of all ages and both sexes had visited
her.&nbsp; Her fees ranged from ls. to 5s., the latter sum being
charged when a &ldquo;planet was ruled.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
stated that her earnings must have averaged several guineas a day
for many months.&nbsp; For the defence it was contended that the
prisoner and her family had told fortunes at Blackpool during the
season for twenty years.&nbsp; She was fined &pound;5 and costs,
with the alternative of two months&rsquo; imprisonment.&nbsp; The
money was paid.</p>
<p>I have visited more than once the gipsies upon Plaistow
marshes in company with Mr. &mdash;, and also with my son, and
found about thirty families squatting about in their vans and
tents, up to their knees in mud, and in a most heartrending
condition.&nbsp; Farmers house their pigs in a much better
condition than we found the poor lost gipsies tented and
housed.&nbsp; Gipsy children came round us by the score.&nbsp;
There would be not fewer than between a hundred and a hundred and
fifty poor little <a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>creatures, growing up without ever visiting either the
school or the church, although there were a magnificent school
and church within a stone&rsquo;s throw.&nbsp; The sanitary
inspector, school board officer, and Christian ministers were
unknown to those wretched, lost gipsy children.&nbsp; They are
fully acquainted with the policeman and his doings.&nbsp; In one
or two of the vans smallpox and fever appeared to me to be at
work.&nbsp; Round the outskirts of London there will be nearly
3,000 gipsies tenting and squatting about.&nbsp; They generally
find the lowest and swampy spots.</p>
<p>My scores of visits to various parts of the country during
many years are not recorded here, but the same sorrowful tale is
everywhere manifest.</p>
<p>It does seem that letters of blood and words of fire will be
needed to arouse the hearts and consciences of my countrymen, and
compel them to observe the dark side of human life which lies
close to our eyes and noses; and to draw the veil of ignorance
away which is preventing the sun of civilization carrying out its
mission among our own outcasts.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The darkness falls, the wind is high,<br />
Dense black clouds till the western sky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The storm will soon begin.<br />
The thunders roar, the lightnings flash,<br />
I hear the great round rain drops dash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are all the children in?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>The Christian Freeman</i>, 1877

</blockquote>
<p>I answer, &ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; and with a tear-fetching pang
I again say, &ldquo;No!&rdquo;&nbsp; The canal and gipsy children
are still outside the door, and our legislators do not care to
open it, owing to the &ldquo;difficulties&rdquo; which prevent
the latch from being lifted up.&nbsp; The nail is in the way, and
the door is locked&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nobody kind words pouring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In that gipsy heart&rsquo;s sad ear,<br />
But all of us ignoring<br />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> 18th of December, 1882, was a
bitterly <i>shil</i> (cold) <i>divvus</i> (day), partly frozen
<i>ghie</i> (snow) lay several inches on the <i>chik</i>
(ground).&nbsp; The <i>d&uacute;vel</i> (sky) was gloomy and
overcast as if threatening this <i>do&#335;velesto-chairos</i>
(world) of ours with a fresh outburst of <i>v&eacute;nlo</i>
(wintry) vengeance.&nbsp; Not a <i>patrin</i> (leaf) was to be

hopping about the <i>drom</i> (road) in quest of

<p>In a few minutes I stood at our door with my old grey coat
over my arm, wondering whether I should in my state of health
face my cold journey to Scotland.&nbsp; After a little
reflection, quickened by &ldquo;the path of duty is the path of
safety,&rdquo; which seemed to be more beautiful than ever, I
started with my bag in hand to tramp my way to the railway
station.&nbsp; I did not feel on the way in a humour for singing,
with cap in hand, and in joyous strains, &ldquo;Oh! this will be
joyful,&rdquo; but could have said with Wesley,</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Be Thou my Light, be Thou my Way.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the train I duly seated myself, and we sped on till I
arrived at Leicester, the seat of stockings and leather.</p>
<p>Leicester is a pleasant town, but, as in the case of other
towns, there are a few&mdash;only a few, thank God!&mdash;fools
in it whose light from farthing candles will become less as her
wise men, good and true, increase.&nbsp; After my landing upon
the platform I made my way to the house of my sister-in-law, and
there rested my bones for the night.&nbsp; During my restless
night, with the full blaze of a lamp shining in my face, some of
the following aphorisms were entered in my notebook:&mdash;</p>
<p>The books of infidels, sceptics, socialists, and atheists may
be compared to handfuls of sulphur cast into the fire of public
opinion.&nbsp; They give a bluish flash for a moment, reflecting
deathly and ghastly hues upon those who stand near; which
sometimes cause children, and those of weak minds, narrow vision,
and short sight to put their hands into the fire to see where the
deathly colours come from.</p>
<p>Righteous kings and queens, doing God-like acts to elevate and
beautify their subjects, may be compared to heavenly gardeners,
whose business in life is to beautify human nature and society
with an increasing number of moral tints and splendour, reflected
by the heavenly throne, and to transmit the colouring rays to the
human flowers growing up under their charge; thus making this
beautiful earth more like Paradise every year.</p>
<p>The righteous deeds of a good king or queen, when they emanate
from a heart filled with heavenly desires to render earthly
subjects contented and happy, are seeds that the spirit of evil
cannot kill.&nbsp; They will live and thrive to the end of time,
and then they will be transplanted to heaven to bloom through
eternity.</p>
<p><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>When
a Christian is said to have taken to doubting God&rsquo;s
goodness, lovingkindness, and fatherly care, he may be said to
have drawn down the blinds of his soul and dimmed his vision of
the beauty, power, and love of Jehovah, the creator and upholder
of all things in heaven, earth, and sea.</p>
<p>Those who through fraud, craft, and deceit obtain the crown of
laurels won by others will find that, instead of the soft,
beautiful leaves, it will turn into a hard crown of thorns, that
will prick sharp and deep enough to touch the quick of the soul,
ruffle the thoughts, disturb the mind, and trouble the
conscience.</p>
<p>As bees in gathering honey from flowers often transmit many
new and lovely colours to plants and flowers, so in like manner
good children in passing into the world among all kinds of
families, especially among the young, change and beautify by kind
words, soft answers, and example the characters of those they are
brought in contact with.</p>
<p>The words used in faith by good Christian fathers and mothers
in blessing their children are jewels, pearls, and other precious
stones, which will be strung together by angelic hands with
golden threads, and worked into patterns that are to adorn the
children as they walk over the plains of Paradise.&nbsp; They are
the immortal flowers of earth, with a life within them that will
transform them into the everlasting flowers of heaven, that will
be strewn by little loved ones upon the path of saints as they
walk the streets of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>It is not always the largest flowers which make the prettiest
bouquet, or adorn a drawing-room to the best advantage.&nbsp; The
little bird&rsquo;s-eye, that grows among the thistles in the
hedge-bottom, is prettier and more modest than the large
sunflower; so in like manner it is not always the big, shining,
dashing, flashing Christian, with <a name="page307"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 307</span>few real good deeds, that is the
most beautiful and lovely in God&rsquo;s sight.&nbsp; The little
Sunday-school scholar, with Jesus shining out of his actions, in
a garret is the most beautiful and lovely to look upon, and
illumines a modest quiet corner with the greatest effect.</p>
<p>Bees gather honey from the most unassuming flowers, which are
oftentimes hid among thorns; so in like manner the sweetness of
heaven is to be gathered from good and lovely children, brought
up by Christian parents, living modestly and quietly in our back
streets among the roughest and lowest of the low, more prickly
than thorns, and more poisonous than poison.</p>
<p>Those short-sighted beings engaged in trying to get virtue out
of a gin-palace will find it harder work than extracting honey
out of a putrifying dead dog.</p>
<p>Double-faced Christians, engaged in trying to draw forth
goodness out of sin, wherewith to quench the qualms of
conscience, will find that they are engaged in a more difficult
task than that of drawing pure spring water from a cesspool.</p>
<p>Words are leaves, prayers bloom, and deeds fruit.&nbsp; If the
tree has grown up under religious influence the kernel contains
seeds of immortality, but if reared under the influence of sin
the kernel will be a rotten core and worse than useless.</p>
<p>To love and to sing is to live, and to hate and to swear is to
die.</p>
<p>Bad deeds, though often written and rewritten, soil the hands
of the scribe, corrupt his heart, taint the olfactory senses of
the reader&mdash;although they may be as angels&mdash;with an
unpleasant odour, offend their eyes, and become in the end
illegible blotches, smudges, and smears.</p>
<p>Good deeds, performed with a good object, eat themselves
clearly and legibly into the pages of history, which time turns
into gold, and leave a pleasant impression upon <a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>the writers
and readers&mdash;although they may be devils&mdash;that time and
men&rsquo;s hands cannot efface.</p>
<p>Those who write flashy, misleading lies of various hues,
whether about gipsy, saint, or angel, will find that they are
earning red-hot coppers, which &ldquo;puffs&rdquo; will not
prevent burning the author&rsquo;s fingers and scratching his
conscience.</p>
<p>Worldly-minded human beings engaged in trying to weave a cloak
of righteousness out of their own evil deeds wherewith to hide
their deformities, ugliness, and consumption, may be compared to
a poor old deformed woman trying to weave a golden cloak out of
rotten straw to hide the wretchedness and misery of Seven
Dials.</p>
<p>Those engaged in reclaiming children from sin and ignorance
are making themselves a silver ladder upon which to climb to
golden fame.</p>
<p>When our ways are clouded by mysteries and doubts, we may take
it for granted that we have got off the road, and are wandering
among marshes and swamps from which fogs and poisonous vapours
arise.</p>
<p>Satan often ties firebrands to the tails of hypocritical
professing Christians, and uses them as Samson did his foxes.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At 6.30 on Tuesday morning I stepped out of doors with my
travelling paraphernalia upon some six-inches deep of newly
fallen snow.&nbsp; My only light was the flickering gas, which
was miserable indeed.&nbsp; Underneath the snowy carpet the roads
felt, and in fact were, like a sheet of glass.&nbsp; If the new
soles upon my shoes had been beeswaxed and polished I could not
have slipped and slurred about more.&nbsp; Sometimes my bags were
in the snow, and at other times I was trying the resisting force
of the lamp-posts.&nbsp; Some of the workmen as they passed me
rolled about as if they were &ldquo;tight,&rdquo; and I daresay
they thought me to be a brother chip.&nbsp; After three-quarters
of an hour&rsquo;s exercise for patience, <a
name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>temper, and
legs, I arrived &ldquo;safe and sound in wind and limb&rdquo; in
a third-class compartment, and without any hot-water bottles to
cheer my onward course.</p>
<p>At Trent Station I spent five minutes with Mr. Taylor, the
fine, good-looking station-master, in talking over the caste,
kind, and character of the gipsies in India, in which country Mr.
Taylor was a station-master for some time.&nbsp; At Settle I
pulled up for a cup of coffee and a sandwich.&nbsp; The little
refreshment-room, about ten feet square, was quite a delightfully
warm, cosy nook.&nbsp; The glasses and decanters of variegated
colours were sparkling, the fire was bright and cheerful, and the
waitress brimmed over with smiles, grace, and good-nature.&nbsp;
I was nearly frozen, and to jump from the freezing train to the
warm sunny &ldquo;bar&rdquo; at one bound was enough almost to
make me wish that a coal truck would get across the line to cause
a delay for half-an-hour.&nbsp; It was not to be, and the cruel
porter bawled out, &ldquo;Take your seats, gentlemen!&rdquo; and
we were off to the snowy region of the North, where all things
are not forgot and sheep looked like rabbits.&nbsp; In puffing
along we passed through the snow-drifts, which two days
previously had held bound by the icy hand of winter eleven trains
and their freights of &ldquo;live and dead stock&rdquo; for
twenty-four hours, bringing forth from the sympathetic wife of
the station-master hot tea, cakes, and coffee for the
travellers.</p>
<p>In passing over the Settle and Carlisle railway I experienced
a very queer kind of sensation.&nbsp; I was in the carriage
alone.&nbsp; For many miles nothing was to be seen but snow and
telegraph posts.&nbsp; The fences were covered, the sheep and
cattle were housed, and, owing to the barren nature of the soil,
there were no trees to be seen peering their heads upwards.&nbsp;
A gloom, without a break or gleam of sunshine, spread over the
face of the heavens.&nbsp; The snow-covered hills and valleys
looked like so many white clouds, and appeared to be undulating
as <a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>we
passed through them.&nbsp; Not a sound was to be heard except the
puffing and punting of the engine as we steamed away, and it
appeared as if we were miles high between two worlds, travelling
I knew not whither.&nbsp; To make myself believe that I was still
in the land of the living and not among &ldquo;the dreary regions
of the dead,&rdquo; I paced my compartment pretty freely, filling
up my time by singing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;One there is
above all others,&rdquo; &amp;c.,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and counting the telegraph posts as we glided along.&nbsp;
Among other things, as I walked to and fro in my solitary
compartment, I jotted down some of the following thoughts and
aphorisms:&mdash;</p>
<p>Faith is the quicksilver of heaven placed in the hearts of
God&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; When it is low or weak, rains and
storms are brewing, difficulties are ahead; and when it is high
and strong, then peace and joy may be expected.&nbsp; Unsteady
Christians will do well to change their quarters.</p>
<p>Every glass of intoxicating drink given by parents to their
children may have pleasure swimming upon the surface, but at the
bottom there will be dregs of groans, and cries that will be
hurled back by the children with vengeance and retorts upon the
names and tombs of their parents as they lie smouldering in their
coffins.</p>
<p>The benevolent actions of earth become at death the flowers of
heaven.</p>
<p>The heavenly influences of God&rsquo;s children in life become
at death the fragrance of eternity.</p>
<p>As the light-giving rays of the sun appear as darkness to
mortals with weak eyes and contracted vision, so in like manner
do the searching and light-giving rays of God&rsquo;s Word appear
as darkness to those whose mind and mental powers have become
weakened through looking into the lovely system of heaven with
narrow, preconceived ideas and notions.</p>
<p><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>Tears
are the dewdrops of sorrow; if of heavenly sorrow, they will be
the means, as they drop to the earth, of watering seeds that will
produce a crop of heavenly joy.</p>
<p>In every cup of sorrow given to us by God to drink there are
mixed up in the ingredients fine precious seeds of a higher life,
greater joy, and abiding peace to bloom everlastingly in
heaven.</p>
<p>Those who dabble in sin stain their hands with indelible ink,
which nothing but grace can remove.</p>
<p>Prayer is a pump-handle, and faith the rods and bucket that
lift the clear spring of heavenly truth into our earthly vessels
to refresh us on the way to Zion.</p>
<p>Hot-tempered and fiery-tempered Christians often expose the
nakedness of their souls.</p>
<p>Those people who think that they can go to heaven by indulging
in worldly pleasure and sin are travelling in a balloon of their
own manufacture, which may carry them high up in the opinion of
worldlings, but in reality they are soaring into the freezing
atmosphere of God&rsquo;s wrath, to come down with a terrible
crash.</p>
<p>A man with a large heart, broad sympathy, but under the
influence of a short temper, often burns his fingers; while the
man with a narrow soul and an envious disposition has a fire
within that will blister his tongue and singe the hair off his
head.</p>
<p>Sacred poems and hymns are the million silver steps leading to
the heavenly city from every quarter of the globe; and the tunes
set to them are the lovely seraphs from the angel-land taking us
by the hand to lead us onward and upward to the golden doors
studded with diamonds and other precious stones, which are opened
to all who have been sanctified and made ready for the
indescribable kingdom within.</p>
<p>Death is the postman from the unknown land&mdash;except <a
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>to those
who have seen it by the eye of faith&mdash;knocking at our
door.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Once or twice we passed several men with shovels in their
hands and dressed in garbs that only required a very slight
stretch of imagination to make us believe that they were in the
Arctic regions searching for the bodies of Sir John Franklin and
his noble crew.&nbsp; Suddenly we dropped upon Carlisle, and for
a few minutes we pulled ourselves together.&nbsp; As there were
no sandwiches to be got, I dined off a penny bun and a sour
orange, the rind of which, owing to my benumbed fingers, sorely
tried my patience, and in retaliation I set to it with my teeth
in a most savage manner, and cast the remnants to the wind to
perish in the mud.</p>
<p>We duly arrived at St. Boswell&rsquo;s Station.&nbsp; I felt
nearly &ldquo;done up,&rdquo; and at this place I slipped,
rolled, and tumbled into an hotel for a warm rest and a
feed.&nbsp; When it was dark I turned out again and made my way
by train to Kelso, the place of fame, and noted for its public
spirit.&nbsp; As I drew near to the town I could have said with
Alfred Miles, in <i>Young England</i>, 1880&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Louder blew the winds and fiercer,<br />
The night was drawing nigh.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the station to the town was a most miserable
half-hour&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; The snow was in heaps, and
travellers had to clutch the arms of friends or foes to enable
them to &ldquo;steer a steady course.&rdquo;&nbsp; The snow
whistled and squeaked under the pressure of the soles of my feet;
for by this time I did not seem to have any other soul.&nbsp;
Sometimes I seemed to take one step forward to two backward, till
at last a &rsquo;busman picked me up and set me down within a
hundred yards of the Temperance Hotel door&mdash;Mr.
Slight&rsquo;s&mdash;which was the nearest he could get me to
without risk to <a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
313</span>life and limb, owing to the great depth of snow.&nbsp;
I felt faint, and the full force of what Marianne Farningham says
in the <i>Christian World</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O God, the way is very long,<br />
And the storms are rough and wild.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Men working in snow, in the blackness of night, beneath the
dull, flickering lamps, and with a heavy, foggy atmosphere
overhead, present a most curious and interesting spectacle, such
as might call forth from nervous, sensitive minds a thousand
ghostly wild conjectures about gipsies, witches, &amp;c.</p>
<p>During the evening &ldquo;mine host&rdquo; invited me, with
some three commercial travellers, to a little family party he was
having, numbering altogether some six gentlemen and eight young
ladies.</p>
<p>Of the gentlemen I will say nothing except that they were very
gentlemanly; but of the young ladies I will say that they were of
the usual agreeable mixture.&nbsp; One was charming, another
sweet, another was lively, another was delightful, another was
pretty, another was pleasant, another was full of grace, and so
on.&nbsp; Of course, each had her own peculiar special graces,
figure, and colour of hair.&nbsp; Singing, playing, lively and
interesting conversation whiled the evening hours away.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding these enchanting proceedings, I did not feel
happy.&nbsp; I tried hard to put a smile upon my face, but
imagined I was not successful, for the company often had to try
to &ldquo;liven me up.&rdquo;&nbsp; The trials and hardships of
the day, and my work on the morrow, weighted me heavily with
anxiety and sorrow.</p>
<p>I retired to my chamber pensive, sad, and cold.&nbsp; My bed
was like ice, and all the clothes, rugs, &amp;c., I had would not
make me warm.&nbsp; The night was shiveringly cold, and my heart
ached for the poor gipsies out in the <a name="page314"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 314</span>snow.&nbsp; I dozed, winked, and
blinked.&nbsp; I got out of bed again and again; and, to while
away the long hours of the night, I jotted some of the following
aphorisms down, by the side of the dying embers of a
<i>little</i> fire:&mdash;</p>
<p>Sunday-schools are God&rsquo;s flower-beds, upon which He
sends more gleams of sunshine and spring showers than upon the
rest of the world.&nbsp; Some Sunday-school children are the
little roses, pinks, mignonette, &amp;c.&nbsp; There are other
Sunday-school children very modest and very good, but with little
show; these are the thyme, ladslove, &amp;c.&nbsp; The naughty
children are the sour and poisonous weeds.</p>
<p>When a Christian leaves the prospect hill for the marshes and
swamps of despondency and gloom, he will soon discover&mdash;or
ought to do&mdash;that he is in the neighbourhood of hellish fogs
and mists, which will lead him into worse than the Roman&rsquo;s
&ldquo;shepherd&rsquo;s race,&rdquo; maze, or labyrinth, and from
thence to gloomy thoughts and hazy notions of God and His
works.</p>
<p>Infidels are the rats of society, puddling and muddling the
rippling streams of pure truth that run through our land.</p>
<p>Cold places of worship, with a shivering minister as
doorkeeper, are the places to turn warm Christians into freezing
saints.</p>
<p>A drunken Christian minister is a toppled-over guide-post with
the bottom rotted off, owing to its having being set in too much
water.</p>
<p>Hope is the second&mdash;love the first&mdash;greatest moral
force in the world.&nbsp; When a man is down in the gutter it
lifts him up; when he is in darkness it puts light in his face
and fire in his eyes.&nbsp; It enters the breast of a child; it
fills the heart, and is seen in every action of man; it is in the
soul of kings, governs empires, and rules destinies; and it lifts
human beings, populating all worlds, from earth and hell to
heaven.&nbsp; Oh! bliss-inspiring hope!</p>
<p><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>Hope
is the father of ambition and the earthly companion of the soul;
they join together till they come to the edge of the river,
whence the soul takes its flight into eternity, and hope becomes
the life of the fame left behind, and ends with fame&rsquo;s
death.</p>
<p>Despair is the wastrel daughter of ambition forsaken by her
father, and her mother, hope and pride.&nbsp; She drags all who
touch her to poverty, ruin, degradation, misery, and death.&nbsp;
When she creeps do you run.</p>
<p>Elevating natural parental love buds in time and blooms
through eternity.&nbsp; It turns a mud cottage or gipsy wigwam
into a palace, a desert into a garden, a waste into an earthly
paradise.&nbsp; It causes the birds and variegated songsters to
chirp and sing round your dwelling, the trees to laugh, the
stones to shout, the cat to purr upon the hearth, and the
children to kiss and fondle upon your knees.&nbsp; It sends whole
families where love dwells off to bed in good humour, and causes
the cock to crow early in the morning at your door, telling you
that a <span class="smcap">diviner love</span> is about to enter
your family circle with a fragrance excelling that of the rose,
and its effects more lovely to behold than that of the lily.</p>
<p>The soil of earth is the brain of nature.</p>
<p>Children with good hearts and lovable dispositions, under the
fostering care of a good, kind, Christian mother, will become
God&rsquo;s pretty little singing birds, to beautify and enliven
His heavenly garden; while naughty, disobedient, bad children
will become worse than rotten eggs, not even fit for manure.</p>
<p>As bells are placed upon the necks of leading wether sheep to
give out a sound of danger and guidance, so in like manner is the
word of God placed upon the necks of His ministers, to give out
words of consolation, counsel, reproof, and warning, and woe be
to those who give out an uncertain sound.</p>
<p><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>Gipsies, vagrants, tramps, and vagabonds are the corns
and bunions of society.</p>
<p>Every kind, benevolent act of a Christian, full of love to God
and man, is a cask of heavenly oil poured upon the troubled
waters of life, and those who go down deep into human misery will
find, by looking upward, as the oil of paradise swims upon the
waves of woe, the beautiful light of heaven reflected upon their
every movement to raise fallen humanity.</p>
<p>The love of God in the heart of man produces a smoothness upon
the surface of his face and body that eases his way to heaven
through the chilling billows of selfishness, deceit, and
fraud.</p>
<p>A cruel retort from an ungrateful son opens a parent&rsquo;s
eyes to his sins and follies more than the advice of one hundred
friends.</p>
<p>To mount the highest hill of God&rsquo;s favour upon the
alternate steps of prayer and good works, with faith as a
handrail, is to see the indescribable beauties of heaven and the
unsurpassed splendour of earth as no other mortal can; and by
climbing higher still we can see more and more, till we find
ourselves lost in love and wonder.</p>
<p>The transparent dewdrops of heaven to be seen, by the light of
the bright morning sun, resting and twinkling into rainbow
colours upon the flowers and blades of grass on the green, mossy
carpet, are the lively, sweet, innocent little children whom God
sends to cheer and beautify our path for awhile before He calls
them to heaven by the absorbing rays of Divine love.</p>
<p>To a good man dark moments are the harbingers of bright days,
and to a bad man light moments of excitement are the precursors
of long, dark days of sorrow.</p>
<p>Love is the greatest moral force in the world.&nbsp; With the
birth of a child it has a beginning, and it is the right hand
companion of the soul; and with the death of the <a
name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>body it is
transferred with its redeemed chief to paradise, to be the
singing, joyful companion of the soul through endless ages and
never-ending delights and pleasures.</p>
<p>Divine love is the celestial life of heaven dwelling in
man&rsquo;s breast, purifying his heart, enlivening his soul,
transforming his affection to such an extent that he can sing in
the midst of a burning, sandy, waterless, parching desert,
&ldquo;Oh! that will be joyful.&rdquo;&nbsp; It transforms the
black demon face of a gipsy, or a child of hell, into the
lovable, smiling face of a child of God.&nbsp; Its possessor can
jump ditches, bound over fences, and scale battlements as easily
as if they were level green, mossy carpets.&nbsp; It makes life
happy, and opens heaven to our view.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After I had passed through this ordeal, I tried pacing the
room with no better results.&nbsp; Notwithstanding these things,
I felt as the Rev. Richard Wilton felt when he penned the
following lines for <i>Hand and Heart</i>, June, 1880:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sufferings are gifts, accept for my
sake,<br />
And from earth&rsquo;s sighs heaven&rsquo;s music shall
wake.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Morning dawned and found me with wakeful eyes ready to receive
it.&nbsp; After breakfast I began to prepare for my journey
through deep snow which had fallen evenly upon the ground to the
height of the stone walls.&nbsp; I found that the postman with
his cart had begun to prepare for the journey, and he calculated
that if all were straight it would take him five hours to
&ldquo;do the eight miles.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mine host&rdquo;
would not consent to this arrangement, and the next best thing
was to hire a horse and trap.&nbsp; So through the deep snow we
started.&nbsp; I had not got very far before my muffler was
frozen and icicles hung round my beard like little
diamonds.&nbsp; A few carts and waggons had been pulled over the
snow in places by the farmers, and had left a few tracks.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding these our old <a name="page318"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 318</span>hunter was not long before he began
to &ldquo;puff and blow.&rdquo;&nbsp; My gigman said, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know whether we shall be able to get through to
Yetholm, but we will go as far as we can.&nbsp; We can but turn
back if we can get no further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our steed did not require pulling up to stop him.&nbsp; Of his
own instinct he stopped pretty frequently.&nbsp; I said to the
man, &ldquo;Our horse seems to be short of
&lsquo;puff.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the
gigman; &ldquo;his wind is touched a little, but nothing to
hurt.&nbsp; He will be all right if we can once pull
through.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes we went into the ditches.&nbsp;
How deep they were before the snow fell I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;
I should think some of them were pretty deep.&nbsp; Thanks to the
Almighty, the bottom of our gig would not let us topple
over.&nbsp; Many times I began to wonder where we should find a
resting-place for the night.&nbsp; I said to my gigman as we went
ploughing through the snow in one of the ditches, &ldquo;In case
we get stuck fast, what shall we do next?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the gigman, &ldquo;we shall have to
leave the trap behind and return to Kelso as best we can.&nbsp;
We shall both have to get upon the horse&rsquo;s back, and if he
will not carry us we must take turn and turn about.&nbsp; It
won&rsquo;t do to stop on the road to perish.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
began to &ldquo;pump&rdquo; my gigman in order to know whether I
was in the hands of one who understood his business.&nbsp; I
wanted my fears settling upon this point.</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;How long have you been a coachman?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Between twenty and thirty years,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And have you ever had a &lsquo;spill&rsquo; or been stuck
fast?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have only had one &lsquo;pitch
in&rsquo; and never a &lsquo;spill.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; This news
gave me confidence in my man, and on we kept ploughing
away.&nbsp; A strong contrast presented itself to our view close
to a cottage just off the roadside.&nbsp; There was a fine dark
woman with a bright scarlet hood and cloak on her big body, doing
something upon one of the hedges.&nbsp; It struck me that she was
bird-liming, for the London markets, <a name="page319"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 319</span>the poor linnets that choose to be
caged rather than to perish.</p>
<p>The sights along the road were most lively, and I shall never
forget it as long as the breath is in my body.&nbsp; The
excitement &ldquo;on the road,&rdquo; the bubbling sympathy
within my breast for the poor perishing rabbits, hares,
partridges, and crows upon our path, the dangers of the way, and
the magnificent grandeur of the scenery, were of such a nature as
to cause me to forget the biting cold at work benumbing my nose,
fingers, and toes.&nbsp; The Scotch firs in the dales and vales
along our path and on the hillsides never appeared more grand and
beautiful.&nbsp; They were artistically touched by the hand of
God.&nbsp; The pure white lovely prismatic children of the clouds
and cold boundless space had descended softly from heaven, as if
loth to leave their pure abode for a resting-place in the mud;
but before doing so they appeared anxious to adorn the trees of
nature with the beauties of ethereal space, and in such a manner
as to cause one&rsquo;s heart to glow with gratitude towards God,
the Giver of all good.&nbsp; The boughs were bent downwards,
heavily laden with the angelic snowflakes; the whole trees
presenting a spiral sight, leading your eyes and mind upwards
toward heaven.&nbsp; At the extreme tips of the branches the snow
had formed a kind of white clapperless bells.&nbsp; As I passed
under the heavily-laden trees I felt that I should like to have
helped them to bear their burden, and also to keep the prismatic
children of the clouds and infinitude from settling into their
dirty resting-places.&nbsp; Nature seemed to speak through the
beautiful snow-adorned trees, and wintry-capped hills and covered
valleys with a warm loving tenderness that I had never
experienced before.</p>
<p>Upon the fences the snow had come softly and stealthily down,
apparently as if in gentle wavelets, which presented the
appearance of fold upon fold, overhanging waves upon <a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>waves in
beautiful round and soft designs; and as I beheld it I felt for a
few minutes that it would be a real pleasure, with joy and
gladness running through my bones, and smiles forcing themselves
upon my face, to roll, plunge, tumble, and fluster under its
overhanging laps and waved folds, which seemed to speak
invitingly, and with open arms, to those who cast a sympathetic
glance at them.&nbsp; Never in this world did snow appear more to
be like the downs of heaven than upon this occasion,
notwithstanding the <i>biting</i> cold day.&nbsp; On this journey
the live things seemed to be dying, while the dead things seemed
to be living.</p>
<p>We had now been on the road ploughing away over two hours
among the snow, and still we were not at the end of our
journey.&nbsp; We had had many escapes of a spill, with the
consolation that we should not have been hurt, except in case the
iron heels of our beast had come sharply in contact with our
almost frost-bitten noses.&nbsp; As we topped the hills and
neared Yetholm it was manifest that the rude hand of storm and
tempest had been busily at work among the trees at some not very
remote period.&nbsp; Hundreds had been uprooted, some of which
were left to tell the tale.&nbsp; Not a public-house was to be
seen on the way.&nbsp; There was a kind of cabin a little off the
roadside, on which was stuck a piece of board, showing that tea,
tobacco, coffee, and snuff were sold there.&nbsp; Among the hills
in the distance Yetholm was observed.&nbsp; The thought that had
run freely through my mind, that I might not reach Yetholm, had
now vanished.</p>
<p>The veritable gipsy town was in sight, and our steed pricked
up his ears and quickened his pace.&nbsp; The blood which had
imperceptibly been freezing in my veins seemed to glow
again.&nbsp; The use of my hands and feet seemed to be coming
round, and into a public-house I stumbled at half past one to get
a cup of tea, &ldquo;a cheer up,&rdquo; and thorough
warming.&nbsp; After which I set out with my bag in <a
name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>one hand
loaded with Testaments, supplied to me by a friend and the
Christian Knowledge Society; picture cards, supplied to me by the
Religious Tract Society; and <i>Our Boys and Girls</i>, supplied
to me by the Wesleyan Sunday-School Union; while in the other
hand I carried a quantity of oranges and tobacco, purchased from
Mr. Laidlaw&rsquo;s, a tradesman in the place.&nbsp; With this
&ldquo;stock-in-trade&rdquo; for the big and little gipsies at
Kirk Yetholm I started my tramp.</p>
<p>The nestling and nuzzling of the gipsy hypocrites beneath the
walls of the church at Kirk Yetholm, when they first landed in
this country and for centuries onward, is only in accord with
their first appearance in many parts of England.&nbsp; There can
be no doubt that when the gipsies came from the Continent they
came as hypocritical, religious, popish pilgrims, and succeeded
well for a time in inveigling themselves into the good graces and
pockets of the well-to-do English men and women, so that many of
them were able to dress in scarlet and gold till they were found
out, as I have shown elsewhere.</p>
<p>Kirk Yetholm, the gipsy town, is about half a mile from Town
Yetholm.</p>

</a></p>
<p>By the time I had arrived at the gipsy quarters, owing to my
loads, the deep snow, and the slippery nature of the roads in
some places, I was ready for a rest.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the village I met a number of little
half-starved, dirty, ragged gipsy children, who, to say the
least, would require a deal of &ldquo;straightening up&rdquo;
before they were ready for angelic robes.&nbsp; One little fellow
with fine lips, but a mouth almost extending from ear to ear,
accosted me in such a manner as to satisfy me that I was, without
doubt, in the land of gipsydom.&nbsp; With the exception of the
fine old church and one or two houses, the whole presented a
miserable appearance.&nbsp; The gipsy dwellings were one story
high, and of a dirty dingy white.</p>
<p><a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
322</span>Leydon&rsquo;s opinion of the Yetholm gipsies in his
day was not very high, for he says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Yeta&rsquo;s banks the vagrant gipsies
place<br />
Their turf-built cots.&nbsp; A sunburnt swarthy race,<br />
From Nubian realms their tawny line they bring,<br />
And their brown chieftain vaunts the name of king.<br />
With loitering steps from town to town they pass,<br />
Their lazy dames rock&rsquo;d on the panier&rsquo;d ass,<br />
From pilfer&rsquo;d roots or nauseous carrion fed,<br />
By hedgerows green they strew their leafy bed;<br />
While scarce the cloak of tawdry red conceals<br />
The fine-turned limbs which every breeze reveals.<br />
Their bright black eyes through silken lashes shine,<br />
Around their necks their raven tresses twine;<br />
But chilling damps and dews of night impair<br />
Its soft sleek gloss and tan the bosom bare.<br />
Adroit the lines of palmistry to trace,<br />
Her horded silver store they charm away,<br />
A pleasing debt for promised wealth to pay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Slater says in his Directory for 1882 that &ldquo;Town Yetholm
and Kirk Yetholm are both very humble in appearance, especially
the latter, which is chiefly inhabited by gipsies, a race
formerly remarkable for their disorderly lives and dangerous
characters, and at this day distinguished by peculiarity of
habits from the general body of the community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Baird says in his &ldquo;Memoir of the Rev. John
Baird,&rdquo; written some twenty years ago, &ldquo;A colony of
gipsies which had long been settled at Kirk Yetholm had given
rather an unenviable notoriety to the village, and rendered its
name familiar to thousands in Scotland.&nbsp; The great majority
of this wandering race were little better than heathens though
born in a Christian land, and were notorious for poaching,
thieving, and blackguardism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most of the gipsy dwellings belong to a friend, the Marquis of
Tweeddale, and he has of late years taken steps to improve their
appearance.&nbsp; At the present time <a name="page323"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 323</span>I am told the gipsy dwellings, so
far as the outsides are concerned, show a great
improvement.&nbsp; Sad to relate, the gipsy tenants have not
improved one jot.&nbsp; Landlords may make gipsies&rsquo; and
labourers&rsquo; houses&mdash;and it is right they
should&mdash;healthy and habitable, but estate agents cannot
purify the moral iniquity that dwells within.&nbsp; The
schoolmaster, law, and the gospel are the agents for this
reforming work.</p>
<p>I was told by Mr. Laidlaw that a gipsy named Mathew Blythe was
the most respectable gipsy in Yetholm, and would give me any
information; so to Mathew I made my way.&nbsp; I knocked at his
door and was met with a shout&mdash;&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I did not stand knocking twice after this invitation, and went
through the dingy, greasy passage&mdash;or &ldquo;entrance
hall&rdquo;&mdash;to another door, which I opened, and there
found a round-faced, grey-haired, good-looking, cobbling gipsy at
work upon his &ldquo;last.&rdquo;&nbsp; The room seemed to serve
for kitchen, scullery, parlour, dining-room, sitting-room,
bedroom, closet, and workshop.&nbsp; For a minute or two he eyed
me over from head to foot before asking me to sit down on a
rickety old chair that stood by my side.&nbsp; I told him that I
was come to look up the gipsies at Yetholm.&nbsp; I was met with
a gruff reply, &ldquo;There are no gipsies at Yetholm; they are
all gone away, and I don&rsquo;t know where they are gone
to.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;I am sorry for that, as I had
brought some books, oranges, tobacco, pictures, and coppers for
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And after a few words in Romany the old man
turned up his face with a smile and said, &ldquo;Well, to speak
the truth, I am a gipsy, but my old woman is not.&nbsp; Sit you
down.&rdquo;&nbsp; I sat down and began my tale, and told him who
I was and all about the object of my visit.&nbsp; At this the old
man opened his eyes wider and wider and said, &ldquo;Lord, bless
you, me and my brother, who lives at Town Yetholm, were only
talking about you yesterday, and saying how glad we should be to
see you.&nbsp; <a name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
324</span>Let&rsquo;s shake hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took hold of
my hand and gave it a good grip and a squeeze, one that I shall
not soon forget.&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;I suppose you wanted to see
me in order to give me a &lsquo;good tanning,&rsquo; or else to
make the place warm for me; for I have been told by a backwood
gipsy writer at &mdash; that the gipsies in Scotland would make
it hot for me if they once got hold of me; and this is one, among
the many other reasons, why I am here to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Those,&rdquo; said Mr. Blythe, &ldquo;who told you that
tale told you a lie.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know any gipsy who would
hurt your little finger.&nbsp; You have said some hard things
about us, but they are true, or nearly so.&nbsp; Why should not
our children be educated like other people&rsquo;s
children?&nbsp; Why should gipsy children not be allowed to sit
on the same bench with the rest?&nbsp; They are the same flesh
and blood, and God looks upon them the same as He does upon other
children.&nbsp; In church and in school no one will come near to
us, and what is the result?&nbsp; Why, there is not a gipsy in
all the place&mdash;and there are between one and two
hundred&mdash;except myself who goes to church on Sundays.&nbsp;
The gipsies in Yetholm are worse off to-day than they ever
were.&nbsp; Some are in receipt of parish relief.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This upsets the romantic tales of the gipsy writers who maintain
that gipsies never receive parish relief.&nbsp; &ldquo;A few of
the children can read and write, but that is all.&nbsp; I learned
to read and write a many years, thank God, and I also learnt to
make and mend shoes.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;What do the
gipsies do and where do they wander, as they grow
up?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They,&rdquo; said Mr. Blythe,
&ldquo;generally goes to town, or travels the country, and nobody
knows where they end their days.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Blythe was some
distant&mdash;&ldquo;ninety-second cousin&rdquo;&mdash;relation
to the notorious dare-devil gipsy, Will Faa, who claimed to be a
sort of a gipsy king, and on this account I wanted to have a few
words about the gipsy kings of Scotland.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Blythe, &ldquo;you <a
name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>know better
than I can tell you that there are no such beings as gipsy kings
and queens.&nbsp; It is all bosh and nonsense, conjured up to get
money on the cheap.&nbsp; The woman they call the gipsy queen
does not live at Yetholm now, she has gone to live at
Kelso.&nbsp; I could not tell you whereabouts she lives, but in
some of the back streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Blythe began to relate some of the gipsy tales; and how
many kings&rsquo; lives the gipsies had saved, and a number of
other things relating to gipsy life, into which I had not time to
enter, as I wanted to be on the road again with my gigman before
it was dark.&nbsp; The old man&rsquo;s crippled foot prevented
him making some visits with me to the other gipsies in the
village, or, as he said, &ldquo;I should have been only too glad
to have done so.&nbsp; The poor things want somebody looking
after them, I can assure you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I emptied nearly the
whole of the contents of my bags of books, pictures, tobacco,
oranges, and a few coppers upon the gipsy cobbler&rsquo;s bench,
among the awls, nails, waxed-ends, &amp;c., for him to
distribute, as a <i>man</i>, among the gipsy children and old
women in the village; and as a <i>man</i>, and with gipsy
greetings and good wishes, trusting to Mr. Blythe&rsquo;s honour,
I left them, and they have, with God&rsquo;s blessing, no doubt
been distributed.&nbsp; After a few words of cheer and
consolation and several shakes of the hands, which somehow
brought out my weakness in tears, I bade Mr. Blythe, the
grey-haired, open-faced gipsy, &ldquo;good-bye,&rdquo; maybe
never to meet again on this side of Jordan.&nbsp; I felt as I
stepped out of the door that I could have said with a blind
writer in the <i>Church of England Magazine</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Though dark and dreary be my way,<br />
Thy light can turn my night to day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pensive I tread my sad and lonely road,<br />
Pain, gloom, and sorrow marked me for their prey.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I took a stroll through the place to eye the gipsy dwellings
<a name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>over,
and by the time I had got to the bridge homeward, a number of
poor half-starved gipsy children had gathered round me.&nbsp; I
had not gone far before I met some bigger gipsies &ldquo;working
<i>home</i>&rdquo; for the night.&nbsp; I thought I would have
five minutes&rsquo; chat in the snow with a little old gipsy
woman named Sanderson, who had accosted me in the usual gipsy
fashion, viz., a curtsy and &ldquo;Your honour, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I pulled up and deposited my bags in the snow.&nbsp; At this the
old woman began to smile; she no doubt thought that she had
succeeded in her first step to draw something from me.&nbsp; She
was not long in perceiving that I was not a Scotchman, and took
pains to tell me her name, and that she was an English gipsy from
the neighbourhood of Newcastle.&nbsp; It occurred to me that I
would just for once try the old woman&rsquo;s volubility of
thanks, and accordingly I dipped into my bag for an orange; this
brought the old woman almost upon her knees with a &ldquo;Thank
yer honour;&rdquo; each &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; was accompanied by
low curtsies.&nbsp; I next pulled out a picture card; this she
put to her breast and said, &ldquo;Lord bless yer
honour.&rdquo;&nbsp; I gave her another card, for which she
responded with upturned eyes, &ldquo;May the Lord bless you, my
dear good gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; I next gave her some coppers;
she again turned up her eyes toward heaven and said with a smile,
&ldquo;May you never want a friend in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
next gave her some tobacco, to which she responded, &ldquo;May
the dear Lord thank you a thousand times.&rdquo;&nbsp; I ran
through all the varieties I had, without exhausting her stock of
thanks.&nbsp; I began to think that I must &ldquo;give it
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; I believe Nisbets, Sunday School Union, Hodder
and Stoughton, Partridge, Religious Tract Society, Christian
Knowledge Society, and all the wide world-known first class
publishing houses in Paternoster Row&mdash;and over London there
are many of them&mdash;would not produce variety of picture books
enough to exhaust the different kind of thanks the <a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>old gipsy
woman had in store; at any rate she would have a curtsy for the
last and one to spare for the next gift.&nbsp; I had a Testament
in my bag, and as a last present I thought I would give it to
her.&nbsp; The old woman took it out of my hand as a hungry
starving child takes a piece of bread, with more eagerness than
she had shown over either the money or the tobacco, and clasped
it to her breast and called out with tears in her eyes in an
attitude of prayer, &ldquo;May the dear Lord Jesus bless you, my
dear good gentleman, so long as you shall live, and may you never
want a friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tears and curtsies came again pretty
freely, I shook hands with the old gipsy, and we parted.&nbsp;
The rimy moisture on my spectacles, and the hastiness of my
movements prevented me testing the old gipsy woman&rsquo;s tears,
to see whether they were genuine or not.&nbsp; I rather think
they were; at any rate it is more pleasant to human nature to
have smiles than frowns, even if they come from the devil.</p>
<p>I jumped into the trap, put on a warm muffler, and jolted and
jogged for some two hours to my lodgings, passing some gipsy
poachers on the way, and watching the growing moon in the heavens
facing me, which seemed to speak words of consolation showing
unmistakably that all was not darkness in the temporary Arctic
cold regions in the world of gipsydom.</p>
<p>In Kelso I found out that one of the <i>princes</i> of
gipsydom had been in jail nearly a score of times; in fact, one
of the magistrates told me that he himself had sent one of the
gipsy vagabonds to jail something like half a dozen times during
the last two years.&nbsp; As a rule, when his
&ldquo;<i>highness</i>&rdquo; was not in jail, he was employed
scraping the streets, scavenging, or getting a penny in other
ways.&nbsp; In the train I was told that one of the <i>queens</i>
of gipsydom indulged in language which would not be a sufficient
passport to heaven, and was at the present time to outside <a
name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>observers a
poor, miserable old woman, with one foot in the grave, a standing
lie to the advantages, blessings, and beauties of an uncivilized,
demoralizing, wandering vagabond&rsquo;s life.</p>

</a></p>
<p>A portrait of one of the self-crowned Scottish gipsy queens,
Esther Faa Blythe, is here given.&nbsp; The old woman is
eighty-five years of age, and has an eye to business.&nbsp; She
is sharp, and can adapt herself to all circumstances.&nbsp; With
the saints she becomes heavenly, and so on, almost through the
whole of the lights, shades, and phases of social life.</p>
<p>There are numbers of &ldquo;gipsy kings&rdquo; and
&ldquo;queens&rdquo; in the country&mdash;aye, almost in every
county; at any rate those who are simple enough to believe in
them say so.&nbsp; One gipsy queen not long ago used to dress in
dashing, gaudy silks, and sit in &ldquo;a chair of state&rdquo;
in her van, and the Londoners paid their threepennies to see her
from time to time.&nbsp; She now lives a &ldquo;retired
life,&rdquo; upon her gains, at Maidenhead.</p>
<p>The best gipsy queen I know of is the good Christian woman,
Mrs. Simpson&mdash;formerly a Lee&mdash;at Notting Hill, who has
become a devoted, good Christian woman, and tries to do all the
good she can as she passes up and down the world.&nbsp; Her Bible
contains her &ldquo;state records,&rdquo; which are the guide of
her life.&nbsp; For twenty years she did a &ldquo;roaring
trade&rdquo; by telling fortunes to simpletons and big babies out
of the Bible&mdash;upside-down at times&mdash;of which she could
not tell a letter.&nbsp; Since she has been a <i>gipsy Christian
queen</i> she has learnt to read some parts of the blessed
book.&nbsp; My plan, if followed out thoroughly in all its
details, will make all our gipsies &ldquo;kings&rdquo; and
&ldquo;queens.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is surprising that there are
people in the world silly enough even at this late day to believe
in such beings as the &ldquo;gipsy kings&rdquo; and
&ldquo;queens&rdquo; of backwood romance.</p>
<p>To come back to Yetholm.&nbsp; The aches, pains, and wild <a
name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>visions of
the night carried me almost over the wide, wide world, and had it
not been for the power of Divine love and the rays of heavenly
light I cannot tell where I might have got to ere this.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;The rougher the
way, the shorter the stay,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>said Wesley.&nbsp; I paid my bill, and started homeward, and
at St. Boswell&rsquo;s station I made the acquaintance of Thomas
Webster, Esq., and his two sweet, interesting little sons,
Masters Thomas Scott Cliff and Harold Colin, of Oxenden Towers,
Dunse.&nbsp; In the train we sat together, and chatted and whiled
away time almost imperceptibly for several hours as we journeyed
southward.&nbsp; At Hillfield we separated.&nbsp; He and his sons
travelled westward, and I kept speeding along southward and
homeward, I think a wiser man; certainly I know more of the
gipsies in Scotland and at Yetholm than I ever knew before.&nbsp;
I find, among other things, that there are a number of gipsies
living among the rocks on the northern coasts of Scotland, more
like wild animals than human beings, and as shaggy as
winter-coated goats.</p>
<p>My visit to Yetholm brought out the fact more vividly to my
mind than ever, that private flickering and fluttering missionary
enterprise, apart from compulsory education, sanitation, and
proper Government supervision, is powerless, and unable to
reclaim our gipsies and their children from heathendom and its
black midnight surroundings; and this I have stated all along in
my letters, Congress papers, articles in the <i>Graphic</i> and
<i>Wesleyan Methodist Magazine</i>, and in my &ldquo;Gipsy
Life,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; The case of the poor brickyard girls
and boys and canal children proves this in an unmistakable manner
beyond all doubt; at any rate, to those who have their eyes and
ears open, and hearts and hands ready to help forward the
country&rsquo;s welfare. <a name="citation329"></a><a
href="#footnote329" class="citation">[329]</a></p>
<p><a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>Some
fifty years ago the Rev. John Baird, a godly minister at Yetholm,
and a few warm hearted friends, commenced in right good earnest
to reform the gipsies at Yetholm.&nbsp; A committee was formed,
several hundreds of pounds were collected, steps taken to get the
gipsy children to school, and for some years they issued
encouraging reports concerning the gipsies.&nbsp; Plenty of
proofs were forthcoming to show that the gipsy children could be
made meet for heaven by the application of the laws of education,
sanitation, and the gospel; they were, as a rule, as well
conducted in school and church as other labouring-class
children.&nbsp; In course of time the missionary zeal of the
committee began to flag, and Mr. Baird handed them over to the
magistrates, and he goes on to say: &ldquo;Take the more
respectable individual, and let him follow the occupation of the
gipsy, and in a few years he will in all probability be as bad as
any of them.&nbsp; It is almost folly and ignorance to say that a
wandering gipsy may be a respectable character.&nbsp; The thing
seems to be possible and, theoretically, not improbable; but
practically the wandering gipsy is almost without exception a
disreputable person.&nbsp; His wandering life leads to
innumerable evils.&nbsp; In kindness to themselves, therefore,
their occupation, were it even a useful one to society, should be
put down; but it is not only useless, but positively injurious to
themselves and others.&nbsp; Their life is one of petty crime;
their death involved in all the gloom of ignorance and
despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What are the results to-day of the years of toil and the
hundreds of pounds which have been spent upon the gipsy children
at Yetholm?&nbsp; Only one gipsy is to be found <a
name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 331</span>going to
church on Sundays.&nbsp; And whose fault is it?&nbsp; Certainly
not the gipsy children&rsquo;s, nor yet that of Mr. Baird and his
friends, but that of the State and the country.&nbsp; Mr. Baird
gave proof that education had made some gipsy children into
useful servants and good citizens; and why not more?&nbsp; Would
to God that our noble Queen, our statesmen, and our
philanthropists would listen to the gipsy children&rsquo;s cry
which has been going upward to heaven from our doors during the
last three hundred and sixty-eight years, and is still unheard
and unheeded by the Christians of England.&nbsp; Their tears,
instead of softening our hearts, have turned them into icicles,
sneers, and frozen sympathies, and the devilish, sensual gipsy
novelists have transformed the bright lively looks of the girls
into wicked designs and immoral purposes.&nbsp; Every retarding
act and backward movement of those who would keep the poor gipsy
children in ignorance will be a thorn in their pillow at the
close of life, as the crest of the eternal wave appears in view
with savage, bewildering reality.&nbsp; It is a serious thing to
drag women and children downhill, and it is one that will not be
banished by the artistic touches of dark, sensual, misleading
gipsy romance, however finely drawn and dexterously spun.</p>
<p>The Yetholm gipsies, living, roosting, and nestling in their
degrading, demoralizing, and squalid manner, have, during the
last three centuries, from beneath the shadow of the sacred
parish church and within the sound of its heavenly chimes, sent
forth into England, Scotland, and the world over two thousand
dark missionaries, trained in all the crimes of sin and
wrong-doing, to spread misery and moral and eternal death on
every hand, without our ever putting out our hands as a nation to
arrest or sweeten the stream of iniquity which has been floating
by our doors for so long.&nbsp; Good Lord, wake us all up from
our sleep of moral death into which we are falling, bound <a
name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>hand and
foot by selfish interests&mdash;money, greed, sensual pleasures,
and fascinating delights.</p>
<p>Gipsying in this country comes up before us in various forms,
enough to send a cold, thrilling shudder through one&rsquo;s
nature.&nbsp; A friend whom I know well, in Leicester, told me
only the other day that one of her distant relations at Greetham,
in Rutlandshire, had <span class="GutSmall">SOLD</span>, some
year or so ago, his dark-eyed and dark-haired pretty girl of
about twelve summers to a gang of gipsies for <span
class="GutSmall">TWO SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE AND A GALLON OF
BEER</span>, and the poor lost creature is now tramping and
travelling the country, no one knows where.&nbsp; This poor
girl&rsquo;s mother is living in comfortable service in
Leicester.&nbsp; One can hardly imagine a husband and wife,
father and mother, so utterly lost to all natural feeling as to
sell their child for half a crown; but so it is, and no doubt she
is making money for the gipsy scoundrels and inhuman
brutes.&nbsp; My heart often bleeds for the little lost gipsy
girl, concerning whom slap-dash gipsy song-writers can call forth
thrills of momentary pleasurable excitement from sensual gipsy
admirers as they pass round the &ldquo;loving cup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I often wonder what kind of song it is the poor child&rsquo;s
inhuman mother sings to while away the pleasurable duties of her
station and the silent hours of the night; and while her
offspring lies like a dog crouched on a heap of straw, half
starved, dressed in rags, filth, and vermin, in some tent at the
bottom of some dark lane by the side of a wood, listening with
wide-open eyes to the screeching of game and weazels, the howling
of the wind, and the beating of the hail and rain against her
thin midnight shelter from stormy blasts.</p>
<p>While in Scotland a friend told me that recently he was in a
hairdresser&rsquo;s shop, and while he was undergoing shampooing
and a scenting process, a poor, half-frozen, half-naked, Scotch
gipsy girl, with dishevelled hair, came, <a
name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>with a
small tin can in her hand, begging with tears in her eyes for
some hot water.&nbsp; My friend was struck with the poor gipsy
girl&rsquo;s sorrowful, soul-mourning condition and request, and
he asked her what she wanted the hot water for.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Please, my good gentleman,&rdquo; said the girl,
tremblingly, &ldquo;my mother&rsquo;s hair is frozen to the
ground, and I want a little hot water to loosen it with.&nbsp;
Mother can&rsquo;t get up till it is loosened, and there is no
one else in the tent to fetch the water and to get her up but me,
sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; What a tale of sorrow did the poor child
relate.&nbsp; How sadly true is this of the gipsies and show
people, and other travelling children all over our highly
favoured and heavenly exalted country to-day.&nbsp; Our gipsies,
by their own wrong-doings, lying, thieving, poaching, cheating,
fortune-telling, idleness, profanity, sabbath-breaking, and other
deadly sins, have bound themselves to the ground under our eyes,
and we have stood by with our hands in our pockets, winking,
blinking, and chuckling at their heartrending condition.&nbsp;
Some thirty thousand gipsy children have, for the last three
hundred and fifty years, received from door to door cuffs, kicks,
crumbs, crusts, smiles, curses, and flattery, but have never,
except in a flickering way, had extended to them the hand of
practical help and sympathy.&nbsp; They have lived on our
commons, in our lanes, by the side of our woods, in our dark,
black alleys, in our prisons and workhouses.&nbsp; The little
seedlings of hope that God has planted in the breasts of the poor
gipsy children, we have, instead of encouraging them, trampled
upon, and the little tender buds and blades as they peeped forth
we have trodden down.</p>
<p>The children are lying and dying in the mud, with none to
deliver.&nbsp; As a result of our negligence and indifference to
the wants of the poor gipsy child, we shall some day have a crop
of thistles, hard, sharp, and strong, difficult to handle and
more difficult to uproot, think about it <a
name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>lightly as
we may.&nbsp; The cries of the gipsy children have filled the
earth, and reached heaven for help; but we have barred the school
doors against them, and locked in their faces the gates through
which they should have been led to health, prosperity,
civilization, Christianity, and heaven.&nbsp; Gipsy women&rsquo;s
wails and gipsy children&rsquo;s cries are going upward and
upward; and to-day the gipsy, show, and canal children are at our
doors dressed in rags and dirt, with matted hair, and tears in
their eyes, beseeching us to take them into our embraces and
soul-saving institutions, to lead them heavenward and to God, and
still we refuse to listen to their entreaties.&nbsp; Shall we
refuse to do so any longer?&nbsp; God grant that there may be a
speedy breaking of bars, bolts, and locks that have bound our
gipsies, show people, and their children to their debasing
customs, and that our noble Queen, Senators, and Lawgivers may
open the doors of the blessed institutions with which our seagirt
isle is covered to our gipsies and their children without one
moment&rsquo;s delay, before our candlestick is removed and glory
departed.</p>
<p>The Englishmen of our England of to-day have it within their
power to show to the world how to improve the condition of the
gipsy and canal children as no other nation has ever had before,
without trampling under foot liberty and civil rights.&nbsp;
Shall we with folded hands stand by with the blood of the canal
and gipsy children hanging upon our garments, with awful effect,
while the lambs of Christ&rsquo;s flock are groping their way to
misery, ruin, and woe?&nbsp; Shall we put out our hand to save
the children?&nbsp; It is for my countrymen to answer
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked my friend John Harris, the Cornish poet, to kindly
help on the cause of the gipsy children, and right gladly he did
it; and here is his touching poem.&nbsp; May it sink deep into
our hearts!</p>

<h3>NOTE.</h3>
<p>In response to the canal and gipsy children&rsquo;s prayers,
cries, and tears, the only answer coming as yet is as follows:
With the assistance of the Government, represented by the Right
Hon. Sir Charles Dilke, M.P., President of the Local Government
Board; the Right Hon. A. J. Mundella, M.P., Vice-President of the
Committee of Council on Education; J. T. Hibbert, Esq., M.P.,
Parliamentary <a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>Secretary to the local Government Board, Mr. Burt,
M.P., introduced the Canal Boats Act (1877, 46 Vict.) Amendment
Bill on April 9th, 1883, and it was read the first time.&nbsp;
When the Bill came on for the second reading on April 18th, Mr.
Salt, M.P., for Stafford, met it with a &ldquo;blocking&rdquo;
amendment as follows: &ldquo;After the Second reading of the
Canal Boats Act (1877) Amendment Bill, to move that it be
referred to the Select Committee on Canals.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>The
Daily News</i> in a leader states: &ldquo;Mr. Salt intends to
move that the Canal Boats Act (1877) Amendment Bill be referred
to a Select Committee.&nbsp; The motion, if carried, would shelve
this useful and unpretending Bill for another
session.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was in the Speaker&rsquo;s gallery, and
saw with sorrowful pangs Mr. Salt move his successful check to
the Bill.&nbsp; This was no sooner done than Mr. P. A. Taylor,
M.P. for Leicester, took his hat off to &ldquo;scotch&rdquo; the
further progress of the Bill.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the
entreaties of Earl Stanhope, Mr. W. E. Forster, M.P., Mr. Pell,
M.P., myself and others, Mr. Salt refused to drop his
&ldquo;blocking&rdquo; amendment, although Mr. Salt and Mr.
Taylor knew full well that any amendment they might propose when
the Bill is in Committee before the &ldquo;House&rdquo; would be
considered.&nbsp; Later on Mr. Warton, M.P. for Bridport, put his
universal block on, as he always does when measures for the
country&rsquo;s welfare come to the front and are likely to pass
into law.&nbsp; In the week commencing April 30, 1883, no less
than twenty-nine &ldquo;blocks&rdquo; had emanated from this
&ldquo;honourable member&rsquo;s&rdquo; brain to be placed
against the legislative action of Parliament for the
country&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>On Friday, April 27th, the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, in a
leader, states Mr. Algernon Egerton, M.P. for Wigan, has
&ldquo;blocked&rdquo; the Canal Boats Act Amendment Bill brought
forward by Mr. Burt on behalf of Mr. George Smith, of
Coalville.</p>
<p>It seems inexplicable that Mr. Taylor, who, as a Member of the
&ldquo;House,&rdquo; helped me to get the Brickyard Act of 1871
and the Canal Boats Act of 1877 passed, should at the last moment
take steps to prevent the success of the Act of 1877 which my
Amending Bill would bring about, and with but little cost or
inconvenience to all parties.&nbsp; Both Mr. P. A. Taylor and Mr.
Salt are friends to the cause I have in hand&mdash;at least I
hope so; but to check the Bill was a backward move.</p>
<p>To turn aside the Christianizing and civilizing institutions
of the country from exerting their influence upon 60,000 poor
canal and gipsy children is no light undertaking.&nbsp; It cannot
be the cause of the poor canal and gipsy children that they wish
to throw cold water upon, but upon my unworthy self, who has had
the audacity, against immense odds and under tremendous
difficulties, to take the <a name="page338"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 338</span>cause of the brickyard, canal, and
gipsy children in hand.&nbsp; Time and patience weave trials into
pleasures and difficulties into crowns.</p>
<p>In the meantime the children&rsquo;s cries are going east,
west, north, and south, upward and heavenward for help.&nbsp;
Shall it be given?&nbsp; They are more in need of it by far than
the children of other working classes.&nbsp; Oh, that a speedy
answer may come, and the children delivered from the vortex of
ruin and the jaws of death by the hand of the most enlighted
Government in the world!</p>

339</span>APPENDIX A.<br />
MY PLANS EXPLAINED AND OBJECTIONS ANSWERED.</h2>
<p>To illustrate more fully the plans I suggest for improving the
condition of the canal, gipsy, and other travelling children, and
to bring to the surface all the weak as well as the strong points
which the working out might reveal, I cannot do better, I think,
than introduce my readers to an imaginary large gathering of my
friends, with a real object in hand, in one of the Committee
rooms at the House of Commons, which list of friends, including
Lord Aberdare, Lord Aberdeen, Lord Stanhope, Sir William V.
Harcourt, M.P., Sir Richard A. Cross, M.P., Sir Charles Dilke,
M.P., Mr. W. E. Forster, M.P., Mr. J. T. Hibbert, M.P., Mr.
Mundella, M.P., Mr. Alexander McArthur, M.P., Mr. W. H. Wills,
M.P., Mr. A. Pell, M.P., Mr. Salt, M.P., Mr. Thomas Burt, M.P.,
Mr. Frank A. Bevan, Mr. Edwin Lawrence, will be found in my
previous works, and earlier in this, together with many other
valuable friends and well-wishers to the cause of the poor
neglected brickyard, canal, and gipsy children.&nbsp; Their names
will ever be remembered and spoken of by me with the profoundest
respect.&nbsp; They are names that stand high in the legislative,
literary, press, philanthropic, social, and religious annals of
our country, irrespective of creed, sect, or party; and nothing,
had space been at my disposal, would have given me greater
pleasure than that of showing my gratitude to them by placing all
their names upon these pages. <a name="citation339"></a><a
href="#footnote339" class="citation">[339]</a></p>
<p><i>Question</i> 1.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would you explain to us more
fully than you have <a name="page340"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 340</span>done in your Congress papers and
&lsquo;Gipsy Life,&rsquo; the plans you refer to for bringing
about an improvement in the condition of the gipsy and other
travelling children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the first place, as I have previously stated, all the vans
and other temporary movable dwellings should be registered in a
manner analogous to that provided under the Canal Boats Act of
1877.&nbsp; The certificate to be renewable annually at any of
the Urban or Rural Sanitary Authorities in the country, the owner
of the tent or van paying a sum of ten shillings per annum; to be
equally divided between the local authorities and the Local
Government Board.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 2.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you explain to us how the
ten shillings is to be collected and divided between the
government and the local authorities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would propose that the five shillings paid to the Government
should be paid in the form of a charge upon each certificate; or,
in other words, each certificate of registration should be
stamped with a five shilling stamp, and collected by the
Government as the other stamps are collected.&nbsp; The other
five shillings should be kept by the local authorities for their
trouble and expense in the matter.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 3.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you propose dealing
with the fines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fines should be handed over to the local sanitary
authorities, who, I suggest, with the sanction of the Local
Government Board, should enforce the Act.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 4.&nbsp; &ldquo;How would you meet the case of
a man who, with his family, is at the end of the year, when his
annual certificate expires, a hundred miles away from the place
where he obtained his certificate of registration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I will try to illustrate my meaning in this way.&nbsp; Suppose
that a man registered his van at Tunstall, Staffordshire, in the
first instance, say, on January, 1883, but during the year he had
wandered all over the country almost, and on January, 1884, he
was at Northampton with his van and family.&nbsp; I propose that
he should take his last certificate of registration to the
sanitary authority at Northampton and get it renewed.&nbsp; This
plan works out right in the case of hawkers.&nbsp; Of course, the
van would have to be brought to the officers, or at any rate, it
would have to be where it could be inspected.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 5.&nbsp; &ldquo;You say in your Congress
papers that the certificate should be taken on the first of
January in each year.&nbsp; Now suppose a man wanted to register
his van in October, would the owner be required to pay the sum of
ten shillings for the remaining two months of the year, and then
be required to take out another certificate on the following
January?&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the plan sketched out in my Congress paper it
would be so; but on further consideration it would, I think, be
much <a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
341</span>more simple, fair, and easy if the certificates were
taken out for a year at any time or place the owner thought fit
to apply for them.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 6.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you explain why it is
that you think the certificates of registration should be renewed
annually?&nbsp; Would it not be sufficient if the vans and
temporary miserable dwellings were registered only
once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, I do not think it would.&nbsp; Vans, as in the case of
canal boats, often change hands, and to keep an oversight of and
be able to trace the vans through all their changes would require
a lot of official and intricate machinery to be set in motion
which would not be needful if the certificates of registration
were taken out every year.&nbsp; Every application for a
certificate or a renewal of a certificate would bring the owner
to the front.&nbsp; The changes taking place during the year
could be endorsed upon the back of the certificate, and with the
transfer of the van I would hand over the certificate of
registration in force to the new owner.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 7.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the advantage to be
gained by registration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Registration is the first step towards the advantages that are
to follow.&nbsp; By registration the owners and occupiers of the
vans are known, and the School Board officers and sanitary
inspectors have the initial powers to bring their influences to
bear upon the children growing up without education.&nbsp; The
gipsies and other travellers as a rule pass through the country
under so many different names that unless the vans are registered
and their owners known it would be impossible to carry out the
reforms that are needed.&nbsp; I have not found one traveller who
would object to their vans being registered, provided it could be
brought about in an easy and inexpensive manner.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 8.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you not think that ten
shillings per annum would be a heavy tax upon the gipsies and
other travellers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not if we take into account that poor people living in houses
have to pay rates and taxes to a much greater amount than I
propose that travellers should be called upon to pay for their
certificates.&nbsp; In fact, they will be much the gainers if my
system of a free education for the gipsy, canal, and other
travelling children be carried out.&nbsp; For the ten shillings
they would, as a rule, receive more than thirty shillings in
educational advantages and remission of school fees.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 9.&nbsp; &ldquo;How will the sanitary and
other authorities know, as the vans pass through the country,
whether they have been registered or not without the inspectors
putting the owners to unnecessary inconvenience and
annoyance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I propose that the name of the owner, the place where the van
was registered, and the number of the certificate should be
painted on the vans and other temporary and movable
dwellings.</p>
<p><a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
342</span><i>Question</i> 10.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you not think that
the travellers and gipsies would be much inconvenienced by having
to register their vans every year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, not if they were habitable, and in a fair condition in
other ways.&nbsp; It would not require more than an hour once a
year.&nbsp; The forms and certificates would only take a few
minutes to fill up.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 11.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you propose bringing
about the education of the gipsy and other travelling
children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would do as I have proposed in my &ldquo;Gipsy Life&rdquo;
and Congress papers, viz., establish a free educational pass
book, which book should not cost the parents more than one
shilling, and on the plan set forth in my &ldquo;Canal Adventures
by Moonlight,&rdquo; p. 162.&nbsp; The pass book would do for all
the children living in the van or canal boat, and the child or
children presenting it to any schoolmaster connected with any
properly organized public school would claim at his hands a free
education for so long a time as they presented themselves for
admission.&nbsp; With the system of pass books there will not be
the difficulties that would have been created by the pass-book
system in the village dame school days of yore.&nbsp; Day
schools, as you know, are now conducted upon the standard and
code system.&nbsp; I will try to illustrate how the plan would
work out in practice.&nbsp; Opposite my room windows across the
green, all last week was an old tumble-down van in which there
was a man, his wife, and seven children.&nbsp; Five of the
children were of school age&mdash;none of them could tell a
letter; but, supposing that Tom was in the First Standard, Betty
in the Second, Bill in the Third, Polly in the Infants&rsquo;,
and Jack in the Fourth Standards, these classifications and
particulars would be entered in the pass book, and supposing that
the gipsy had sent the children with their pass book to the
National School on his arrival in the village, the schoolmaster
would immediately he had opened the book have seen to which
standard each child belonged, and would have sent him or her into
it.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 12.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you not think that it will
cause the schoolmaster extra trouble; and how do you propose to
meet this difficulty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have talked to several schoolmasters upon the subject, and
they think that all attendances of travelling children should be
entered and paid for at the rate of those children who pass their
examinations.&nbsp; Each child who passes the usual examinations
costs the country about tenpence per week, and I have been told
by schoolmasters that if this sum was forthcoming from the
Government for the gipsy and travelling children&mdash;which is
the system I propose to meet the case of the canal
children&mdash;they would gladly receive them into their schools;
or, in other words, the Government must pay the schoolmaster one
penny for each attendance, which should be entered in <a
name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>his school
returns to the Education Department; the same course in some
respects which is taken with pauper children.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 13.&nbsp; &ldquo;What plans do you propose for
granting the gipsy and canal children their certificates of
qualification?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would propose that the children should be allowed to present
themselves at any school for an examination at the usual time;
<i>i.e.</i>, provided they had made two hundred attendances
during the year, and that such attendances had been duly entered
in pass books and signed by the schoolmasters at whose schools
the children had attended; or that they satisfied the school
attendance officers or School Board authorities, wherever their
vans were registered, that the gipsy children were being educated
privately, or in other ways to their satisfaction.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 14.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you not think that there
will be much difficulty in getting the children to make two
hundred attendances during the year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; As a rule, all travelling vans, canal boats, and
other miserable dwellings are not on the move more than half the
time.&nbsp; Frequently they will stay for weeks together in one
place.&nbsp; And I would also, to enable the children to make
their number of attendances, reckon two attendances in a
Sunday-school equal to one day-school attendance.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 15.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you not think that parents
of town children will object to their sitting by the side of
gipsy and canal children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In some instances the parents might object to it, as you say,
but generally they would not.&nbsp; I think that two-thirds of
the children now travelling the country are the children of
parents who once followed town and settled employments.&nbsp; If
the children I want to introduce to the day schools throughout
the country had been gipsy children of past years, with all their
evil habits manifested at every step of their lives, I can
imagine that strong objection would be raised against their
introduction to English school life.&nbsp; Our present gipsy
children are, as a rule, our travelling gutter children.&nbsp; I
think that the mixing of the travelling children with the town
children at school will be one of the first steps towards
bringing them back to civilized usages and habits.&nbsp; At the
present time gipsy and canal children are the outcasts of
society, unknown and unrecognized by others, except by those of
their own kith and kin.&nbsp; The mother has at the present time
no object to &ldquo;dress up her children for.&rdquo;&nbsp; With
its introduction to school, natural instincts, parental feelings,
love, and hope are brought once more into action, and generally
the natural consequence will be that the mother will send her
children to school as clean and well dressed as other children
are.&nbsp; To have separate schools for canal and gipsy children
will not be a workable plan.&nbsp; Sometimes for weeks the
teacher would scarcely have anything to do; gipsies especially
fluctuate very much.</p>
<p><a name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
344</span><i>Question</i> 16.&nbsp; &ldquo;We should be glad if
you could give us additional reasons and facts, and explain a
little more to us why you think that vans should be registered
annually, or at any rate have their certificates
renewed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the first place, I would say that the non-annual
registration was, and is so still, one of the principal causes
why the Canal Boats Act of 1877 is not so satisfactory as
desired.&nbsp; The children living in canal beats under the Act
of 1877 really belong to the place at which the boats are
registered.&nbsp; This is as it should be, and I want the
principle of localizing or identifying the canal children with
some place extended to all travelling children living in vans;
but that identification must give the parents a choice of
selecting other districts or localities from time to time as
changes of circumstances and other things might require.&nbsp;
Under the present system, when once the boat is registered at a
place, the children, under the Act of 1877, belong to that place
till they are past school age, and no provision is made under the
Act for changes which often occur in a boatman&rsquo;s life, or
would occur in a gipsy&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; I will try to
illustrate my meaning more clearly by taking a case in point as
regards the carrying out of the Canal Boats Act, which would
apply with equal force to children living in vans.&nbsp; When the
Canal Boats Act of 1877 came into operation, either through the
strictness or laxity of other registration authorities, more than
eight hundred canal boatmen and boat-owners from all parts of the
country applied to the Runcorn registration authorities to have
their boats registered.&nbsp; Of course they registered the
boats, and obtained the five-shilling fees.&nbsp; After a time it
was found out that the School Board authorities at Runcorn were
called upon to provide school accommodation for nearly two
thousand boat children, which they could not do.&nbsp; At any
rate, they did not wish to saddle the town with the expenses of
educating boat children from all parts of the country, and from
whom they received nothing in return; and the consequence is the
two thousand boat children whose floating houses are registered
at Runcorn are going without education to-day, and their patents
cannot, so long as this registration exists, place them in any
other School Board district in this country.&nbsp; The annual
registration which I propose will give the boating and gipsy
parents the opportunity of changing their homes or headquarters
without detriment to the children, and the establishment of more
registration districts would, I am thoroughly convinced, place
the matter on a satisfactory and workable basis.&nbsp; If John
Jones during the year ceased working his boat in and out of
Runcorn, and took to Paddington&rsquo;s scented waters, he could,
by registering his boat at Paddington at the time of the renewal
of his certificate, put his children under the London <a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>School
Board, which he cannot do under the present system.&nbsp; To meet
the case of the gipsy and van children, any sanitary authority
should be a registration authority, or at any rate at those towns
where hawker&rsquo;s licences can be obtained.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 17.&nbsp; &ldquo;How would your plan work out
in the case of those families who live part of the year in vans,
and the other part of the year in houses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would propose that their vans should be registered at those
registration districts in which the owner of the van has his
settled home.&nbsp; I will illustrate this in the following
manner.&nbsp; Suppose an owner of a van, after travelling the
country during the summer months, draws his van into a yard and
takes to house dwelling during the winter.&nbsp; Of course, the
children during the winter months will be under the School Board
authorities, at the place where his house is rated for the relief
of the poor and other rates; but supposing&mdash;as is often the
case&mdash;with the dawn of spring the gipsy traveller desires to
leave his house during the summer mouths, and takes his wife and
children round the country, I would suggest that he should
provide himself with a free educational pass book, and that he
should be compelled to send his children to some day school the
required number of times, and it would be the duty of the School
Board officers where his van is registered, together with the
School Board officers where the vans may be temporarily located,
to examine the pass book, and to see that the educational clauses
were carried out.&nbsp; In case of village feasts the children
should be sent to the next village school.&nbsp; Children can
easily make the number of attendances.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 18.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is your opinion about
the education gained in this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will not be the best education in the world, but it will be
a thousand times better than none at all.&nbsp; It would cause
them to see some of the advantages of education, and it would
start their young ideas up civilizing channels.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 19.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would it not be a hardship
upon the parents if the children were not allowed to work in
connection with their vans and shows until they had passed the
Third Standard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They would not be in a worse position than other working
classes are.&nbsp; As a rule, they spend much more money in drink
than labourers in our towns and villages do.&nbsp; All the
working classes, except the two I refer to, are prohibited from
sending their children to work before they have passed the Fourth
Standard, and I am sure that the little gipsy, acrobat and other
children attending stalls, shows, and cocoa-nut establishments
endure more trying occupations, long hours, and severe toil than
our factory children.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 20.&nbsp; &ldquo;How would you deal with those
gipsies, and others <a name="page346"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 346</span>who are living and huddling together
in old vans and other places, whose travelling homes the Sanitary
Inspectors would not pass as habitable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There would be three ways open to them: First, they must be
compelled to hire a habitable van, which vans can be had on hire
at Bristol and other places; or, secondly, they must go into
settled homes; or, thirdly, we must apply the plan I propose for
granting them long leases of common or waste land at a nominal
rent.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 21.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you explain why it is
that you would charge ten shillings per annum for vans, and only
five shillings per annum for canal boats?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Canal boats are engaged in furthering commerce, and thus add
to the wealth of the country.&nbsp; In the case of gipsy vans,
the owners use the roads of the country and pay neither rates nor
taxes, and they do not, except those who use their vans to hawk
goods round the country, add to the welfare of the nation, and
for that reason I would suggest a little heavier registration
fee.&nbsp; Gipsies and canal boatmen can move about the country
for centuries and not be called upon to pay one farthing for any
kind of rates, which is a pleasure they ought to enjoy without
one moment&rsquo;s delay.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 22.&nbsp; &ldquo;You say in your Canal Boats
Act Amendment Bill, and you want the principle extended to vans,
that no child or young person should be allowed to work for
either hire or profit on Sundays.&nbsp; Would not this be rather
hard upon poverty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The law prohibits children and young persons being employed in
other occupations, and there is no earthly reason why the poor
travelling children should toil seven days a week.&nbsp; I claim
that if children employed all-week in light healthy work are
exempted from Sunday labour, then most surely children tramping
the country in vans should have the same right.&nbsp; In Section
21 Clause 3 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, 41 Vict. ch.
16, it is laid down that &ldquo;a child, young person, or woman
shall not be employed in a factory or workshop&rdquo; with some
exceptions; so you will see that I do not go so far as the
Section I have quoted does, although the travelling children need
the protection more.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 23.&nbsp; &ldquo;How would you do in the case
of boats conveying perishable goods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boats should be worked by adults as fly boats are.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. 24.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you not think that your
plan would interfere too much with the liberty of
Englishmen?&nbsp; Ought not a traveller to be allowed to live
where he likes and how he likes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes: providing it were good for the nation and everybody did
the same.&nbsp; My plan would not interfere with the liberty of
the gipsies and other travellers nearly so much as the law
already interferes with the <a name="page347"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 347</span>liberties of others of her
Majesty&rsquo;s subjects.&nbsp; People living in ships, houses,
palaces, cellars, barracks, cabs, coaches, and carriages have to
conform to healthy rules and sanitary requirements.&nbsp; I knew
a case of a travelling house conveying small-pox to a large town
and causing more than 2,000 deaths.&nbsp; I have known over and
over again of cases where infectious diseases have been carried
through the country by means of canal boats and vans.&nbsp; Only
the other day a man, wife, and five children came to our door
with an old tumbledown pony and rickety waggon.&nbsp; The little
box upon the top of the waggon, used as &ldquo;sleeping
apartments&rdquo; for the whole of the family, would not be
seventy cubic feet of space.&nbsp; Even in this little crib the
five children were all ill of a highly infectious disease, which
they were carrying through the country.&nbsp; The two main
influences I want to bring to bear upon the little travellers and
their homes are the universally acknowledged social laws for
elevating those living in the gutter, viz., education and
sanitation.&nbsp; With the thorough application of these to
little gipsies I shall be satisfied, and then the children will
have made the first step in a gradual improvement, leading them
to Christianity and civilization, so that they shall be strong
enough in brain and muscle to turn the world upside down and
downside up.&nbsp; I want the road to school made easier than the
road to jail, and I would prefer seeing the sanitary inspector
and School Board officer walk into the gipsy vans than either the
policeman or the doctor.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 25.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you propose carrying
out the Act?&nbsp; Would you leave the matter entirely in the
hands of the local authorities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I propose that the registration and local inspection should be
done by the local authorities in the town or places through which
the vans passed or stayed, as the case might be.&nbsp; I do not
think that it would be wise to place the actual working out of
the plans I propose in the hands of the Local Government
Board.&nbsp; The Local Government Board should only be called
upon to appoint one or two Inspectors to visit the fairs and
other places occasionally to see that the local authorities
properly carried out the Act.&nbsp; I recommend the same course
in the &ldquo;Canal Boats Act Amendment Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 26.&nbsp; &ldquo;How would you propose paying
the Government Inspectors?&nbsp; Would their salaries be an
increased charge upon the Treasury?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No: the Inspectors would not cost the country one farthing, as
the profits arising from the 5s. stamped registration
certificates would more than pay the Government for their
expenses of supervision; and the other 5s., together with the
fines, would satisfy the local authorities.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 27.&nbsp; &ldquo;What number of travelling
families are there in the <a name="page348"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 348</span>country who would be called upon to
take out annual registration certificates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should think at a rough calculation there will be between
six and eight thousand, which would yield a sum of &pound;1,500
to &pound;2,000 annually.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 28.&nbsp; &ldquo;You refer in your Congress
papers to the granting of a portion of land to certain classes of
the gipsies who are desirous of settling down, on long leases at
a nominal rent.&nbsp; Do you think the gipsies would agree to
this plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do most assuredly&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, if any reliance is to
be placed upon their own statements, and I think they are worthy
of credence.&nbsp; In the first place, the land should be granted
to those gipsies who have been on the road during the last twelve
months only.&nbsp; Secondly, I would grant to each family of man,
wife, and two children, four acres; this would, after the first
year, enable a man to keep a cow and grow vegetables enough for
the family.&nbsp; Supposing there were three thousand families,
they would require 12,000 acres of waste land.&nbsp; To meet the
expenses, and to provide ways and means, a society should be
founded principally upon philanthropic and business principles
combined, and this&mdash;or, better still, the
Government&mdash;should grant small sums of money to the tenants
by way of loan at a small interest, to enable them to erect a
hut, and to provide food for the first year.&nbsp; Of course the
money should be advanced gradually as the work and other things
progressed.&nbsp; I should think that &pound;100 for each family
would be amply sufficient to tide them over the first year, to be
spent as follows: &pound;30 for the hut; &pound;40 for one
year&rsquo;s keep; &pound;17 for a little Welsh cow; &pound;3 for
pig and fowls; and &pound;10 for tools and implements.&nbsp; The
Society advancing the money should have a lien upon the land
until all the money advanced had been paid back.&nbsp; Proper
safeguards would have to be taken on all sides.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 29.&nbsp; &ldquo;What would be the ultimate
effect of this plan of allotting land to the gipsies and other
travellers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gain would be infinite.&nbsp; The men, women, and children
would be drawn from a life of vagabondage, theft, and idleness to
one of work and profit to themselves and the country&rsquo;s
good.&nbsp; Of course all would require time to work out.&nbsp;
If the three thousand families were eating bread of their own
earning, and cultivating twelve thousand acres of land which is
at present bringing forth nothing but moor game and partridges,
the results would be heavenly and eternal pleasure to themselves
and the country.&nbsp; Any of my plans would be a thousand times
better than destroying parental responsibility by taking their
children from them by force and sending them to industrial
schools, &ldquo;and turning their parents loose&rdquo; upon
society to inculcate their idle, lying, cheating habits and
customs into others <a name="page349"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 349</span>they may be brought in contact with,
who stand ready with open mouths to receive gipsy lies, damning
tricks, cheating, and lore as gospel.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 30.&nbsp; &ldquo;On behalf of the various
Christian churches throughout the country, would you kindly tell
us what steps you would take for improving the spiritual
condition of the gipsies, canal boatmen, and other
travellers?&nbsp; Would you organize a missionary society with a
staff of officials, secretaries, travellers, agents, &amp;c.,
with headquarters in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; If such an organization was started it is my decided
conviction that but little good would be the result.&nbsp;
Missionaries, like other folks, desire to see the fruits of their
labours, which, owing to the fluctuating habits of the boaters,
gipsies, and others, they are unable to see.&nbsp; The only way
in which missionary organization could work successfully would be
to have a few vans and temporary booths, such as some of the show
people use as &ldquo;boxing establishments,&rdquo; and to place
them in charge of a good man and his wife, who would live in the
van and visit some of the principal fairs in the country.&nbsp;
Religious services and a Sunday-school could be conducted in the
booths on Sundays, and a day-school for those children whom the
law would allow to travel with their parents on week days, or at
any rate on the morning of fair days.&nbsp; The man and his wife
could conduct a religious service at nights, and also distribute
during the day, when not engaged in the school, religious
periodicals and other literature of the kind.&nbsp; By far the
better plan will be for the various religious denominations in
each town to set to work in right good earnest to remedy the evil
as it comes periodically into their midst.&nbsp; Local missionary
societies might be formed, composed of all sections of
Christ&rsquo;s Church, to erect a temporary wooden booth to stand
side by side of the devil&rsquo;s booths during fair time.&nbsp;
Here religious services could be conducted by various societies
in their turn.&nbsp; The members of the Church of England to have
the use of the booth, say on Saturday; the Wesleyans, Monday; the
Congregationalists on Tuesday; the Baptists on Wednesday; the
Primitive Methodists on Thursday, and so on through the week, the
various sections following each other in their proper
order.&nbsp; Sometimes it would happen that the Wesleyans would
have the booth on the Saturday night, and the Church of England
on the Sunday.&nbsp; I am not a believer in a work of this kind
being left to a few.&nbsp; It should be the duty of all
Christians and philanthropists to help forward the cause of the
children.&nbsp; Those who give money would give time too, if
asked and set to work.&nbsp; As a rule the givers are the
workers, if they know when to begin and how to begin.&nbsp;
Another plan would be to follow the usual course carried out in
missioning back streets, &amp;c., viz., to sing, distribute
tracts <a name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
350</span>among the travellers, gipsies, and others, speaking at
the same time faithful words of counsel, reproof, warning,
caution.&nbsp; Whatever course is followed, the persons engaged
in trying to improve the condition of the gipsies and others must
not go about it in a kind of stand-off manner.&nbsp; When they
want to shake hands with either canal boatmen or gipsies, their
fingers must not be put out as if they were tied upon the end of
a cold poker, and they were afraid of the rough grip of a gipsy
crushing it to powder.&nbsp; A warm heart and a pleasant word are
passports that will admit any man or woman into boat cabins,
gipsy tents, and travellers&rsquo; rooms.&nbsp; A prying
inquisitiveness these people abhor and detest, and they will
resent it to the utmost.&nbsp; Any little matters relating to
their lives, habits, &amp;c., they will tell to friends whose
object is their good without &ldquo;pumping.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whoever
ministers to the boatmen, gipsies, or travellers must be prepared
to eat at their tables, and drink out of their cups, even if it
be on the ground among mud, out of a dirty basin, and served with
dirtier hands.&nbsp; They do not think they are dirty, and those
who visit them must, if they mean to do any good among them, shut
their eyes and hold their tongues to things they do not
like.&nbsp; Little acts of kindness are not forgotten by them,
and a word of faithful reproof they will
appreciate&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, if it comes from a man or woman who
means their present and eternal welfare.&nbsp; I have said most
hard and faithful things to them, as most people know, for which
I have not at their hands been subjected to insult or
abuse.&nbsp; In a few cases where I have been misunderstood, I
have come in for my share, but afterwards they have been sorry
for it.&nbsp; The electrical sparks of sympathy in their nature
will not manifest themselves at the touch of selfish hands.&nbsp;
It is only the love and sympathy in the hearts of those who visit
them that brings out the finer feelings of the boaters and
gipsies to perform deeds of love.&nbsp; I now say again, what I
have often said before, that the best missionary agency for
effecting their spiritual good will be the proper carrying out of
an Act on the lines I have laid down.&nbsp; When once the
children are taught to read, the next step should be to see that
books of the right kind are placed in their hands, and, with the
blessing of Heaven, the first step towards a moral reformation in
the habits, lives, and customs of our gipsies, canal boatmen, and
other travelling tribes and classes, will have been taken for
their eternal welfare.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 31.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you give us any proof of
gipsies having taken to civilized customs and usages, having
risen in the social scale equal to other law-abiding
subjects?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I will only give you a few names.&nbsp; One of the best and
sweetest singers who ever sang before the Russian nobility was a
gipsy damsel.&nbsp; One of the best actresses that ever put her
foot upon an English stage <a name="page351"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 351</span>was a gipsy.&nbsp; A celebrated
Scotch clergyman of this late day is of gipsy parentage; and so
is also one of the present-day Wesleyan ministers.&nbsp; Some
sculpture and carving in the large hall of the House of Commons
is from gipsy hands; at any rate there was more than two-thirds
of gipsy blood in the artist&rsquo;s veins&mdash;I have been told
that he was a thorough gipsy.&nbsp; The wife of one of our
celebrated London architects is, or nearly so, of gipsy
parentage; and the beautiful little songsters she can paint are
most charming.&nbsp; You could almost imagine when you see her
handiwork that you could hear the pretty little creatures
warbling and piping forth God&rsquo;s praises.&nbsp; They adorn
many drawing-rooms.&nbsp; Recently I have heard of two gipsies in
Surrey who own two rows of houses as a result of their civilized
habits.&nbsp; Others could be named who have saved money, and are
a credit to themselves and the country.&nbsp; John Bunyan was a
gipsy, as every one knows who has read his work and studied his
temperament, habits, character, early life, and
surroundings.&nbsp; If there had never been a gipsy in the world
but John Bunyan who had risen out of a wigwam, he would afford
sufficient proof that gipsies, if taken by the hand, can step
towards heaven, and draw others up after them.&nbsp; I knew a
number of gipsies who have lived decent lives and have died happy
in God.&nbsp; There are to be seen to-day gipsies wending their
way to God&rsquo;s house on Sundays, preparing themselves for the
changes which await us all.</p>
<p><i>Question</i> 32.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before we part we should like
to ask you what effect legislation would have upon the travellers
and gipsies?&nbsp; Would the numbers increase or
decrease?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the proper carrying out of the education clauses and
sanitary plans I propose, wisely and firmly, the number of
gipsies would very soon decrease, and the sanitary inspectors and
School Board officers would be the instruments for bringing this
desirable result about.&nbsp; Persecution, policeman, and the
jail will cause gipsyism to grow, while education and sanitation
will divert it into healthy channels.</p>

352</span>APPENDIX B.<br />
LETTER TO THE RIGHT HON. EARL ABERDARE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following remarks are the
substance of a letter I sent to the Right Hon. Earl
Aberdare&mdash;who has been a friend to the cause I have in hand,
and more than kind to myself&mdash;on May 24, 1882, in reply to
some questions his lordship put to me with reference to some of
the details of my plans for properly carrying out the Canal Boats
Act of 1877; and as they will apply with equal force to the
carrying out of my gipsy plans when my Canal Amending Bill is
passed, I deem it right that they should find a place here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the present time there will be, at a rough
calculation, nearly 10,000 boats registered.&nbsp; In 1879 there
were over 5,000 boats registered, and the number, owing
principally to my continued agitation, has kept increasing.&nbsp;
Supposing that there are only 10,000 boats registered&mdash;with
the prospect of another 5,000&mdash;this would, if the
registration certificates were stamped with a half-crown stamp,
as I suggest to be paid by the boatowner, produce an annual
amount of &pound;1,250, which would be quite sufficient to cover
the expenses of Government supervision, inquiries, and annual
reports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than half of the hundred registration authorities
throughout the country do not pay any increased salaries to the
local registration officers for registering the boats, and the
little inspection that has been done by them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some instances &pound;10 per annum has been added to
the salaries of the officers.&nbsp; In some cases more than
&pound;10, and in other cases less than &pound;10 has been
added.&nbsp; In one instance the amount of &pound;1 per boat has
been given to the medical officer of health for registering the
boats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The officers, in my humble opinion, best qualified to
see to the inspection and registration of the boats under the
Amending Bill are the sanitary officers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not propose, nor do I think that it would be wise
under present circumstances, to establish an army of Government
inspectors, with all their attendant charges upon the
Treasury.&nbsp; One or two Government officials supervising the
carrying out of the act and making occasional and unexpected
visits to various canal centres or otherwise, <a
name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 353</span>and also
advising and working with the local registration officers in the
carrying out of the Act and the regulations of the Local
Government Board, is what I would recommend, at any rate in the
first instance.&nbsp; Of course time and practice, as with other
Acts, would develop the weak and faulty places&mdash;if there be
any&mdash;of the measure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To meet the expenses of the registration and increased
salaries of local inspectors, I propose that the master or
captain of each boat shall pay to the local registration
authorities an annual sum of two shillings and sixpence at the
time when the annual certificate of registration is taken out;
this would bring the total amount of the registration to the same
as that now charged, viz., five shillings, for the first year,
and the only registration that has taken place.&nbsp; No plan
will be a success unless the certificate of registration be
renewed annually.&nbsp; When the Act of 1877 came into operation
it was expected by the boatowners and boatmen that there was to
be an annual payment and registration fee, and I did not hear of
any objection to it worth naming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the first registration, and with the assistance
of the Government inspectors or supervisors, the carrying out of
the Act of 1877 and this Act will not be so troublesome and
expensive a matter as is supposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think that, after a year or two, when the Act
has got into working order, there will be any difficulty in the
registration authorities being able to obtain an annual
registration fee of five shillings, apart from the stamped
certificates, which would make a total of seven shillings and
sixpence for each boat.&rdquo;&nbsp; [With the payment of this
amount, supposing that the canal children are receiving a free
education, as I suggest they should, the boatmen with children of
school age will be more than &pound;1 per annum gainers.]&nbsp;
&ldquo;Even this amount is but a trifle when it is considered
that boatmen and boatowners use the resources of the country, and
neither pay rates nor taxes for their boats floating upon our
rivers and canals.&nbsp; Or if it was advisable to raise the
local registration fee from that which I now propose, viz., half
a crown, to five shillings, it could be done without increasing
the registration fee to be paid by the boatmen to the
registration authority by dropping the half-crown stamped
certificate and the Government paying for the expenses of
Government supervision and inspection out of the Imperial
Treasury, which, I am told, they are unwilling to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To illustrate my meaning more clearly with reference to
the registration fee I am now recommending, I will take the case
of Leeds as a sample.&nbsp; Up to 1879 the local inspector at
Leeds had registered two hundred canal boats at five shillings
each, producing the sum of &pound;50 to meet the expenses of the
local inspection and <a name="page354"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 354</span>registration, and not one farthing
in either fines or fees has been received by the registration
authority at Leeds from the boatowners or boatmen since for the
inspection and registration.&nbsp; Whatever little time has been
devoted by the local authorities to the carrying out of the Act,
it has been done at the cost of the ratepayers at Leeds.&nbsp;
According to the plan I propose there will be, under the Amending
Bill, a yearly income from two hundred registered boats of
&pound;25 to the Leeds registration authorities, and &pound;25
per annum to the Government for the two hundred stamped
certificates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may add that the annual registration fee is fixed by
the Local Government Board in their regulations, and can, without
a fresh Act of Parliament, be altered at any time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another source of income to the local authorities,
provided for under the Bill, and which would help to make the Act
of 1877 and this Act thoroughly successful, will be that derived
from the fines, which, under the Act of 1877, have hitherto been
handed over to the county funds instead of to those who have been
at the expense and trouble of enforcing the Act.&nbsp; The fines
and fees will, I think, cover the whole of the expenses without
taking any money from the local rates, or drawing upon the
Imperial Treasury to any extent worth naming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In course of time, as the Act worked out, it might be
desirable that the captain or master of the boat should have a
certificate of qualification or registration, to be renewed
annually.&nbsp; The better class of boatmen would be pleased with
this arrangement, and it would have a beneficial effect upon the
boatmen generally, as in the case of captains of vessels,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Objection might be taken to the yearly registration of
canal boats.&nbsp; Some might say that registration every three
years would be quite sufficient.&nbsp; The yearly registration,
if carried out upon a plan set forth in my &lsquo;Canal
Adventures by Moonlight,&rsquo; page 219, would be a very much
simpler affair than even in every three years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canal boats often change hands both as regards
ownership and mastership.&nbsp; To register the boats every three
years it would be necessary, in order to keep a clue of the
boats, to have clerks and a set of books wherein to enter the
frequent changes.&nbsp; This plan in many cases would be a
troublesome matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boats registered every year would be easily kept in
view.&nbsp; The annual registration would bring both the
boatowner and captain to the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owing to the children living in the boats being under
the school authorities at which place the boats are registered as
belonging to, it might be desirable, for many reasons, that the
place of registration should be changed.&nbsp; I will take a case
to explain my meaning.&nbsp; <a name="page355"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 355</span>Suppose a boat is registered at
Liverpool for three years; the children living in the boat,
according to the Act of 1877, belong to Liverpool the length of
time for which the boat is registered.&nbsp; But suppose in the
course of a few months after the boat has been registered for
three years the captain or master comes to work his boat near
London.&nbsp; Naturally the captain would like to have his home
and family near London and his children going to school near
him.&nbsp; If the boat was registered at Liverpool for three
years he could not remove his family till the time of
registration was expired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The yearly registration would simplify the whole thing,
and to a great extent overcomes cases of the above kind.&nbsp;
With a change of the registration authority, a change of the
school authority to which the boat children belong takes place as
an outcome of the registration of the boats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This remarkable book is partly an autobiographical
sketch of character, partly a record of a singularly bold and
successful attempt to explore a country which at the time when

<p>&ldquo;Professor Vamb&eacute;ry, of Pest, has just published a
book in England that tells the story of his life; a book that
forms, under every aspect, most agreeable reading.&nbsp; It is
not only a deeply interesting account of his adventurous career,
but it is also written in a light and attractive manner, so that
the reader&rsquo;s attention does not flag for a
moment.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Die Gegenwart</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The character and temperament of the writer come out
well in his quaint and vigorous style. . . .&nbsp; The
expressions, too, in English, of modes of thought and reflections
cast in a different mould from our own gives additional piquancy
to the composition, and, indeed, almost seems to bring out
unexpected capacities in the
language.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>.</p>

the wanderings of Oliver Goldsmith. . . .&nbsp; The English
public will find their interest in him increased rather than
diminished by this graphic account of his life and

reflections during the summers of many years.&nbsp; Some of these
are descriptive, with that fine photographic accuracy which marks

contain those subtle reflections on society, religion, laws,
literature, which also characterize whatever Thoreau wrote, and
which pique the curiosity and stimulate the minds of his
readers.&nbsp; The book has a full index.&nbsp; Thoreau himself
seems to have contemplated a work of this kind, for in his

which should be written in its own season and out-of-doors, or in

relationship of man to the eternal, but the antique garb somewhat
veiled her purpose, while here (in &lsquo;Pilgrim Sorrow&rsquo;)
she moves amid modern as well as universal life, and is thus able
to reveal the whole depth of her feeling and lament.&nbsp; For
what has inspired her poetic phantasy is the ever-unanswered
question: Wherefore and whence is sorrow in the world?&nbsp; The

Persian Poet Firdusi.&nbsp; By <span class="smcap">Helen
Zimmern</span>, Author of &ldquo;Stories in Precious
Stones,&rdquo; &ldquo;Life of Lessing,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; With
Etchings by L. <span class="smcap">Alma Tadema</span>, R.A, and
Prefatory Poem by E. W. <span class="smcap">Gosse</span>.&nbsp;
Popular Edition, Crown 8vo., cloth extra.&nbsp; 7s.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Charming from beginning to end. . . .&nbsp;
Miss Zimmern deserves all credit for her courage in attempting
the task, and for her marvellous success in carrying it out. . .
.&nbsp; Miss Zimmern has indeed mastered a pure simple English
which fits the antiquity of her subject, and the stories are told
in a manner which must provoke the envy and admiration of all who
have attempted this singularly difficult style of
composition.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Saturday Review</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The carefulness and intelligence she displays in her
selections from the &lsquo;Sh&#257;h N&#257;meh,&rsquo; no less
than in her graceful renderings of them, are deserving of high
praise. . . .&nbsp; Miss Zimmern&rsquo;s translations in this
volume can be read with great pleasure. . . .&nbsp; A striking
feature of the volume is Mr. Gosse&rsquo;s narrative poem,
&lsquo;Firdusi in Exile,&rsquo; in which is told, in charming
verse, the picturesque story of the poet&rsquo;s exile and
death.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Zimmern has succeeded to admiration. . . .&nbsp;
The result appears in a language at once dignified and simple,
free from affectation, and at the same time sufficiently
antiquated to carry one into the atmosphere of the stories
themselves. . . .&nbsp; The choice of legends is a wise
one.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>S. Lane-Poole</i>, <i>in The
Academy</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Zimmern has been well advised in attempting to
paraphrase this work.&nbsp; In one volume she presents her
readers with the essence and the gist of Firdusi&rsquo;s Epic,
carrying the story down as far as the death of Rustem&mdash;that
is, as far as the end of the purely poetical portion of the
poet&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; She has selected well, and written the
stories in a vivid style.&nbsp; Firdusi&rsquo;s stories may have
a chance of becoming really popular in
England.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Times</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Miss Zimmern&rsquo;s fitness for writing stories of
this kind there need be no question.&nbsp; She has in other
fields of literature shown how well she could adapt the
productions of foreign writers to British
tastes.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Scotsman</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The author has produced a little volume
well suited to attract the attention and stimulate the curiosity
of the student.&nbsp; By clothing the dry details of
morphological construction with information as to the life
history of plants, and by calling attention to the varied
adaptations of form to function, he has followed in the wake of
that numerous band of naturalists who have at once done so much
to extend the bounds of botanical science, and to make it
attractive to the
amateur.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>.</p>

<p><a name="footnote161"></a><a href="#citation161"
class="footnote">[161]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Our <span
class="smcap">Gipsy Children</span>.&mdash;(To the Editor of the
<i>Daily News</i>.)&mdash;Sir, I counted to-day at the great
Oxford Fair over two hundred and twenty vans and covered carts,
in each of which there would be an average of four children and
two men and women living and huddling together regardless of
every principle of decency.&nbsp; In many cases filth, dirt, and
ignorance prevailed to an alarming extent.&nbsp; Not a few of the
poor women and children exhibited signs of their having been in
close warfare with rough treatment.&nbsp; Not five per cent. of
the thousand human beings could read and write a sentence.&nbsp;
What a farce upon our Christianity and civilization it is to have
this mass of human beings living actually in the centre of
learning, religious influences, and civilization.&nbsp; We have
Bibles, ministers, colleges, sanitary officers, and education
inspectors on every hand, and no power but the police-man
exerting any influence over our poor lost wanderers.&nbsp; What I
want is that their thirty thousand children should receive a free
education&mdash;as I propose in an amending Bill to meet the case
of the canal children&mdash;and their vans registered and brought
under the influence of the sanitary officers on a simple
plan.&nbsp; The gipsies themselves will hail a measure of this
kind with considerable delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This letter brought forth a reply, to which I rejoined as
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your correspondent&rsquo;s repudiation of my statements
in your issue of the 5th inst. does not alter the facts&mdash;not
&lsquo;ideas&rsquo;&mdash;which were given to me by the
travellers themselves in broad daylight in the midst of a pouring
rain, with the object of getting their condition improved, not by
winking and blinking at the evil and allowing it to grow into a
more dangerous sore, to be dealt with by the policeman, but to be
faced by extending the blessings of a free education to all
travelling children, and bringing sanitation to their
homes.&nbsp; His statements about immorality have been
manufactured by himself; but as he has been good enough to take
my references and weave them into a cap which fits, I must allow
him the pleasure of wearing it.&nbsp; The sad facts, seen by
myself, in my possession, in addition to those published in my
&lsquo;Gipsy Life,&rsquo; will most assuredly come to light some
day.&nbsp; With reference to his remarks about no gipsy vans
being at Oxford fair, this is absolutely untrue.&nbsp; I look
upon all as gipsies who, with gipsy blood in their veins, are
tramping the country, hawking and adopting gipsy usages, customs,
slang, and &lsquo;rokering,&rsquo; if only slightly.&nbsp; The
fact is the old-fashioned gipsies are dead, and their places are
being taken by increasing numbers of travellers who are not so
romantic, living in covered carts and waggons, whose wives
sometimes scrape together a little money in the summer to keep
many of the men in idleness in the winter.&nbsp; Your
correspondent takes credit for the education of the children in
the winter.&nbsp; This he knows perfectly well is what the law
requires of those who have settled homes, but he is silent about
the worse than undoing the teachers&rsquo; work in the summer;
thereby placing the poor gipsy children upon the vagabond&rsquo;s
path to ruin.&nbsp; Of course all are not alike.&nbsp; There are
the usual good, bad, and indifferent among them.&nbsp; The sad
condition, morally, socially, and religiously, of many of the
poor gipsy and other travelling women and children is truly
horrible, and no amount of wincing at the shadow of redeeming
features which are to follow will stop me till the 70,000 canal
and gipsy children are educated by means of a free pass book, the
hard lot of the women lightened, and their travelling homes made
more happy and conformable with civilized notions and ideas; and
if he is wise he will help forward the work, with a willing
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote215"></a><a href="#citation215"
class="footnote">[215]</a>&nbsp; It is said that Lord
Beaconsfield in his youthful days attended the place of worship
to which the poor girl referred; and it is also stated that the
bones of one of Cromwell&rsquo;s generals lie smouldering in the
dust within or near the sacred precincts.&nbsp; Extremes meet
sometimes.</p>
<p><a name="footnote329"></a><a href="#citation329"
class="footnote">[329]</a>&nbsp; On March the 5th, within three
months of my visit to Yetholm, Mr. Laidlaw writes me to say that
the Yetholm gipsies are taking to settled and constant employment
at the farmers&rsquo; in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; This is
cheering news, and shows most clearly that my plans will work out
rightly, as I have told the gipsies at Yetholm and other places,
without any inconvenience to them worth naming.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
